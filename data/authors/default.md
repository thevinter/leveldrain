Iâ€™m a dumb fuck that mostly writes OSR content and philosophical considerations

In this blog you will find play reports, module reviews, random ideas and tables to populate your games.

Currently I'm playing AD&D 1e, but I've been trough B/X, 2e, OD&D and other FOE stuff (Mothership, Into The Odd, Electric Bastionland, Mausritter, Mork Borg, \*hack...)

\* Long-hafted, pointed weapons, such as the spear, lance (when used dismounted), pole arm, or trident, inflict double damage when set to receive a charge and the foe actually charges. The lance inflicts double damage when used by a character riding a charging heavy warhorse or similar animal; if the attacker is mounted on a normal riding or cavalry horse, the damage should be reduced.

\* Heavy crossbows may not be used from horseback; only a footman can brace them correctly before firing.
† Some specially-made bows (sold at special cost if at all—GM’s discretion) permit the user to add his or her strength bonus to damage inflicted with the
weapon. Otherwise the strength damage bonus with missile weapons is restricted to hurled weapons (axes, hammers, clubs, darts, javelins and spears)

\* For non-magic armour. Magic armour is un-encumbering, and allows a maximum move rate 30 ft faster than normal (up to 120 ft). Magic shields
weigh as much as normal shields of the same type.

# Armour Table 2

| Type of Armour           | AC Rating |
| ------------------------ | --------- |
| None                     | 10        |
| Shield only              | 9         |
| Leather or padded armour | 8         |
| Studded leather or ring  | 7         |
| Scale or lamellar        | 6         |
| Mail hauberk or byrnie   | 5         |
| Banded armour            | 4         |
| Plate                    | 3         |

The AC rating of a character employing a shield is improved by 1, so a character wearing leather armour and carrying a shield would be AC 7, while a character with plate armour and shield would be AC 2. Magic armour with a rating of +1 reduces AC by 1, +2 reduces by 2, and so forth; the principle is that a positive rating for a magic item shows that it is beneficial, but AC is rated on a descending scale whereby the lower the figure, the better the protection

Shields do NOT affect armour class where the target is being attacked from the rear. Likewise, a figure attacked by several opponents may only employ the shield against one (in the case of a small shield), two (in the case of a medium shield) or three (for a large shield) attacks in any one given round; thus AC against multiple opponents will tend to deteriorate.

This table should not be used to extrapolate monster armour types. These are assigned rather than calculated. For example, most hobgoblins are AC 5, but this does not mean that the hobgoblin will automatically be wearing chain mail armour worth 75gp! More than likely, the creature is wearing a mishmash of assorted pieces of armour of negligible value, but its armour class is considered to be 5 owing to its combat skill and the needs of the game system

Elfin mail counts as normal (chain) mail except for the purposes of weight calculation and encumbrance. It is rarely sold, but suits are occasionally fashioned by elven master craftsmen as gifts for those who have performed some great service for the elven race. 99% of them are awarded to elves, the majority of the remainder to humans or half-elves. Dwarf-sized or smaller suits are prohibitively rare.

Field plate is optional, and rather anachronistic (and hence not listed on the standard tables). It means the Gothic and Milanese plate of the fifteenth century or later. If field plate is used in a campaign, it should be treated as having an AC modifier of -8 (i.e. field plate plus shield would be equivalent to AC 1) and a maximum movement rate of 90 ft. Some GMs may also wish to permit full plate, representing the jousting or tourney plate of the same period and later, which should be treated as having an AC modifier of -9 and a maximum movement rate of 60 ft.

Druids are restricted to armour that does not contain metal. They are permitted leather (optionally studded leather at the GM’s discretion) and shields not bound with metal. A wooden shield bound with rawhide costs the same, and has the same characteristics, as a small shield.

Thieves are restricted to leather or padded armour. Some kindly GMs permit thieves to use studded leather or elfin mail. Normally, plate gauntlets and helms must be removed before missile weapons such as bows can be employed.

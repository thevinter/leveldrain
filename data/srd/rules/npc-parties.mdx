**Numbers & Classes:** There will always be 2-5 characters in a party, with additional henchmen or hirelings to round the entire party out to 9 persons. To determine the number of characters present, roll 1d4+1 and note the result. Next, roll d% on the sub-table below to determine the profession for each NPC. The GM should ignore or alter any results that exceed the maximum number for that profession or yield contradictory results (i.e. a paladin and an assassin). The remaining party slots should be filled with henchmen/hirelings (see below for instructions).

### NPC Levels:

The level of each NPC will be equal to the level of the dungeon on which they are encountered through dungeon level 4. After that, they will be between 7th and 12th level (1d6+6). From dungeon level 13 and downwards, they will be between 11th and 16th level (1d6+10).

## Demi-humans and Multi-Class NPCs:

As a guideline, assume Demi-human NPCs and henchmen to be approximately 20% of the total number of characters in the party. If the randomly generated class is severely limited or impossible for the particular race, use that class or its closest equivalent as one of the 2 or 3 classes for that individual NPC. Approximately 50% of Demi-humans will have 2 professions, and another 25% will have three. To randomly determine race and chance of multi-class professions, refer to the following table:

<RollableTable
  input={`| **d%** | **Race** | **% Multi-class** |
|-|-|-|
| 01-25 | Dwarf | 15% |
| 26-50 | Elf | 80% |
| 51-65 | Gnome | 25% |
| 66-75 | Half-elf | 80% |
| 76-85 | Halfling | 15% |
| 86-00 | Half-orc | 50% |`}

## Hirelings and Henchmen:

Hirelings and men-at-arms will only accompany their employers when encountered on the 1st-3rd dungeon levels. On deeper expeditions, the entourage will be made up only of henchmen. Determine the ability scores, class and level of hirelings and henchmen by rolling on the appropriate sub-tables in the "Hirelings and Henchmen" section. They will have one third the level of their master plus 1 level for every 3 of their master's levels. For example, a 9th-lvlmagicuser NPC may be accompanied by a 6th-lvl magic user henchman.

Equipment: NPC parties should be equipped with arms, armour and supplies typical to a party of dungeon delvers. Henchmen should be assumed to have equipment ap- propriate to their level. Hirelings will only possess lower quality arms and armour and few supplies.

### Spells:

The GM should assume NPC and henchmen spell- casters will have memorised a full assortment of spells appropriate to their party as a whole.

### Notes on Play:

When a player party encounters a party of NPCs and their henchmen, the GM should carefully consider the alignment and makeup of the NPC party before determining their course of action. A relatively weaker NPC party than the players' may use alternate means to resolve the situation. Trickery, parley, bluffing and fleeing are all important possibilities to consider before finally resort- ing to combat. Unless they are surprised, the GM should always treat them as alert and prepared for anything. Once actual contact has been made with an NPC party, the GM should check for reaction. Whatever the result of the negotiations, NPC parties will NEVER choose to join the PCs unless it is to their immediate advantage. This should also involve few if any rewards for the players' party. Unlike monster encounters, the GM should personally direct the actions of the NPCs as if they were player characters. Rather than checking morale as usual, the GM should favour the course of action that is likely to bring the NPCs the greatest benefit.

If the NPC party bests the players they need not kill them. Ransom, slavery, imprisonment or sacrifice are interesting alternatives to simple execution.

Finally, it is highly recommended that the GM prepare for encounters with random NPC groups before actual play begins. By generating a list of such parties in advance, the GM can quickly refer to them without stopping play. After the encounter the GM can either cross-off the NPC party from his or her list or make additional notations for future reference.

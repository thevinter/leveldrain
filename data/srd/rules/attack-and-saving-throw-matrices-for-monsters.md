Most monsters use the attack matrices of fighters. The GM should convert the monster's Hit Dice to a level equivalent according to the following guidelines:

| **Monster HD** | **Equivalent Level** |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| Up to 1-1      | 0                    |
| 1-1            | 1                    |
| 1              | 2                    |
| 1+1 to 2       | 3                    |
| 2+1 to 3       | 4                    |
| 3+1 to 4       | 5                    |
| 4+1 to 5       | 6                    |
| 5+1 to 6       | 7                    |
| 6+1 to 7       | 8                    |
| 7+1 to 8       | 9                    |
| 8+1 to 9       | 10                   |
| 9+1 to 10      | 11                   |
| 10+1 to 11     | 12                   |
| 11+1 to 12     | 13                   |
| 12+1 to 13     | 14                   |
| 13+1 to 14     | 15                   |
| 14+1 to 15     | 16                   |
| 15+1 to 16     | 17                   |
| 16+1 to 17     | 18                   |
| 17+1 to 18     | 19                   |
| 18+1 to 19     | 20                   |
| 19+1 or higher | 21                   |

The above table is also used to determine the monster's saving throws. Most monsters will save as fighters, but the GM should use discretion in following this guideline; in cases where the monster clearly possesses the abilities of another class, consideration should be given to using that matrix instead. (A good example might be a goblin shaman, which could save as a cleric instead of a fighter.)

In the case of powerful monsters that duplicate the abilities of several classes, the most favourable table should be used. (For example, a spell-casting dragon might save as a magic user or a fighter, whichever is better.) The level at which monsters cast spells is also normally determined by their hit dice unless the creature's description indicates otherwise. For example, a magic-using dragon with 11 HD would cast spells as a 12th level spell caster.

Huge but unintelligent creatures may have their equivalent level reduced for the purposes of saving throws, subject to the GM's discretion; creatures such as dinosaurs would be appropriate for this. On rarer occasions, it may also make sense to reduce the creature's effective level for the purposes of attack tables also; this might apply to a herbivorous dinosaur, for example.

Please note that certain creatures have a special bonus to their effective attack level. Stirges, for example, are creatures with 1+1 hit die that attack as equivalent level 5.

Generally, the GM should take account of situations such as positional bonuses. For example, where a group of monsters is attacking the party from a height advantage using spears, the GM may well wish to increase their effective equivalent level by 1.

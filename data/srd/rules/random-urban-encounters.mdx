Player characters are also likely to have random encounters when roaming the streets in a town or city. The GM should check for random encounters every three turns or as desired. The GM is encouraged to design his or her own encounter charts keyed to each district or ward. When a pre-designed table is unavailable, the Urban Encounters Table is useful for most circumstances. The GM should exercise discretion when generating random encounters and keep in mind the particular place where the encounter occurs. Improbable or inconvenient results can be ignored and treated as if no encounter occurred. The GM is also encouraged to disguise the true nature of urban encounters by describing NPCs in vague and/or similar terms.

## 0-level NPCs

Most of the NPCs encountered while adventuring in urban or civilised countryside areas are normal folk, with no adventuring profession such as fighting, spell-casting or thievery. These normal humans may vary slightly accord- ing to the particular milieu, but can be roughly grouped into 5 general types according to their level of activity.

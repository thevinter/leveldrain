A character’s basic attributes are represented in the game by six “ability scores.” These abilities are Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intelligence (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha). The fi rst three represent the character’s physical qualities, and the second three his or her mental ones. Each of these abilities is represented by a number from 3-18, the higher the better. The Game Master (“GM”) will decide how you should generate these scores. For a truly brutal game, characters are generated using 3d6 for each ability in order. Because these numbers will be relatively low (compared to other methods for generating scores, described hereafter) and cannot be switched around, the players will be forced to use their utmost skill in creating a party of adventurers from whatever raw material the dice hand to them.

Many GMs will allow the players to roll up six ability scores
and then decide which scores will go with which ability. This
gives the players more fl exibility to create a good party and to
decide among themselves who will be playing which class. A
player may come to the table wanting to play a particular type
of character, and unless the gamers agree that they want to
test their skills with a completely random challenge it is usually
best to let the players take on the fantasy roles that satisfy
them most.

As well as eliminating or reducing the randomness of a character’s strengths and weaknesses, the GM may also allow players
a bit of a numerical advantage. Many GMs permit ability scores
to be rolled using 4d6, dropping the result of the lowest die.
This method, obviously, will tend to result in higher scores.

### Strength

Strength (“Str”) is a measure of physical power, and is the most
important attribute for fighters. If a fighter, paladin, or ranger
character rolls an 18 strength, the player then rolls a d%, and
that number is added as a decimal, or percentage, to the 18
strength. (See the table below for details.) A roll of 00 on the
percentage die indicates a strength score of 19. Members of
other classes cannot naturally gain strength in excess of 18.
The following table summarises the bonuses and penalties for
strength scores. Note that an “Extraordinary Success” indicates the possibility for extremely strong characters to perform
exceptional or normally impossible feats of strength, such as
opening a door which is held closed by some relatively minor
magic rather than a lock.

| Strength    | Bonus to Hit | Bonus to Damage | Encumbrance Adjustment (lbs) | Minor Tests (d6)           | Major Tests (d%) |

### Dexterity

Dexterity (“Dex”) is a measure of the character’s speed, handeye coordination, and nimbleness of foot. It affects the accuracy of missile fi re and the character’s ability to dodge blows,
so a high dexterity score can be extremely useful to characters
of any class. It is the most important ability score for thieves.

Except in surprise situations, dexterity does not modify the
initiative roll in melee combat. However, it may modify initiative in missile combat (see “Combat”)

| Dexterity | Surprise Bonus | Missile Bonus to Hit | AC Adjustment |
| --------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| 3         | -3             | -3                   | +4            |

| 7         | 0              | 0                    | 0             |
| 8         | 0              | 0                    | 0             |
| 9         | 0              | 0                    | 0             |

| 19        | +3             | +3                   | -4            |

### Constitution

Constitution (“Con”) is a measure of the character’s overall
health and vitality. A high constitution score can give the character bonus hit points (“hp”), so it is a desirable score for any
character class. Constitution is also important in two other
regards, for it determines both a character’s ability to survive
being raised from the dead (Survive Resurrection/Raise Dead)
and to survive a traumatic magical change in form, such as that
caused by a polymorph spell (Survive System Shock).

| Constitution Score | Hit Point Bonus per Die                       | Survive Resurrection/Raise Dead (d%) | Survive System Shock (minor test) (d%) |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |

### Intelligence

Intelligence (“Int”) is a measure of a character’s raw mental
power—his or her ability to calculate, recall facts, and solve
abstract problems. It is the most important attribute for magic
users and illusionists. Intelligence also determines how many
additional languages the character may learn beyond those he
or she knows at the start of play.

Characters with intelligence higher than 18 are not affected
by certain spells of the illusion type (whether cast by a magic
user, cleric, illusionist, etc.). A character with intelligence 19
is immune to the effects of fi rst level illusion spells. If a character were somehow to attain the godly intelligence of 20, he
or she would also be immune to second level illusion spells,
and so on.

| Intelligence Score | Maximum Additional Languages |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 3                  | 0                            |

### Wisdom

A character’s wisdom score (“Wis”) indicates how “in tune”
the character is with his or her surroundings. This translates not
only to general awareness, but also to mystical attunement and
the ability to understand peoples’ motives. It is, in many ways,
a measure of the “sixth sense.” Wisdom is the most important
attribute for clerics and druids

| Wisdom Score | Mental Saving Throw Bonus |

### Charisma

Charisma (“Cha”) determines the character’s maximum
number of henchmen (see Chapter III), the henchmen’s loyalty (which is also applied as a modifier to the henchmen’s
morale scores, see “Morale” in Chapter III) and a Reaction
Bonus. The Reaction Bonus should be added to the d% roll
which indicates how an NPC or creature reacts to negotiation
approaches; scores under 30% will generally indicate hostility
or attacks, while higher scores may indicate a willingness to
negotiate or even make friends. Note that a character is not
always permitted a Reaction roll, since some creatures will be
hostile irrespective of the character’s charisma, and of course
any negotiation approaches must be made in a language that
the creature understands

Charisma does not determine the outcome of negotiations,
although it will affect them. The GM may well wish to roleplay
through the encounter and determine the creature or NPC’s
reactions based on what the player says rather than the scores
on the character sheet.

For players who understand the importance of henchmen and
use them intelligently, charisma is the most important attribute
in OSRIC.

Rangers are a special variation of the fighter class. They are modelled on such characters of fi ction as Aragorn and Robin Hood and are particularly expert in wilderness situations. Rangers are defenders of the poor and serve to protect civilisation from the evil forces that lurk beyond civilised lands.

Rangers must abide by certain limitations, in the same fashion as paladins:

First, the ranger must always remain of good alignment (lawful, neutral or chaotic). Any deliberate change in the ranger’s alignment away from good will result in the character becoming a mere fighter, with 8-sided hit dice, never able to regain rangerhood. An unintentional change will transform the character into a fighter as above, but in this case, with sufficient questing and atonement, the ranger may be permitted to recover his or her status. The GM will determine the precise details of this process according to the situation.

Second, rangers may not employ mercenaries or servants until they reach 8th level or higher. Even once permitted, a ranger may not employ any mercenary or servant who he or she suspects (or ought to suspect) is not of good alignment.

Third, a maximum of three rangers may travel or operate together at any one time.

Fourth, rangers travel light and may not keep any more treasure than they can lift (including any amount the ranger can carry on his or her steed, if any).

## The Ranger Character

- **Minimum Scores:** Str 13, Dex 6, Con 14, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 6
- **Hit Die Type:** d8 (max 11 at 10th level)
- **Initial Hit Die\*:** 2
- **Alignment:** Any
- **Experience Bonus:** Str, Int, and Wis 16+
- **Armour/Shield Permitted:** Any
- **Weapons Permitted:** Any
- **Weapon Proficiencies:** 3 + 1 every 2 levels
- **Penalty to hit for non-proficiency:** -2
- **Weapon Specialisation:** Optional

\* Rangers are different from fighters and paladins in terms of hit points. Rangers roll 8-sided dice to determine their hp, but they receive two such dice at first level. They gain 1d8 per level thereafter until they achieve a ceiling of 11 hit dice (at tenth level).

## Ranger Class Abilities

### Alert Against Surprise:

Rangers are less likely to be surprised (only on a 1 on 1d6), and more likely to surprise others (1-3 on 1d6) than other character classes

### Damage Bonus vs Humanoids:

Rangers receive a bonus of +1 damage per ranger level against evil humanoid or giantish opponents (including such creatures as orcs, goblins, and giants, for example). Thus, a 3rd level ranger would receive +3 damage per hit against these creatures. This damage bonus applies only in hand-to-hand “melee” combat

### Tracking:

Rangers may track other creatures, with a base 90% chance of success in rural settings (modified by the GM according to such factors as the age of the trail, the prevailing terrain and current weather conditions) and a base 65% chance in urban or dungeon settings (again, modified by the GM to take account of local conditions).

### Weapon Specialisation (optional):

With the permission of the GM, weapon specialisation may be selected during character generation. If weapon specialisation is not selected during character generation, it remains forever unavailable to the character, barring some magical or divine intervention.

If weapon specialisation is in play, rangers may take a second proficiency in the same weapon as the first, granting them one extra attack every 2 rounds with the weapon (hence 3/2 attacks with a melee weapon at 1st level, 2/1 at 7th and 5/2 at 13th), +1 to hit and +2 damage owing to their skill. Specialisation costs one proficiency “slot” for melee weapons and crossbows, and two “slots” for missile weapons other than crossbows.

## Advanced Abilities

### Bonus Attacks (8th level):

Rangers gain additional attacks as fi ghters do, but less swiftly. A ranger has one attack at 1st to 7th level, 3/2 attacks at 8th to 14th level, and two attacks at 15th and above. If the optional weapon specialisation rules are permitted by the GM, rangers may specialise as fighters do, save that they receive fewer proficiencies and gain extra attacks more slowly as described above.

### Spellcasting (8th level):

At eighth level, rangers receive limited spell powers, drawn from the Druid and Magic user spell lists according to the table given above.

### Band of Followers (10th):

Rangers of 10th level or higher receive a special body of followers. The GM will determine the exact nature of a ranger’s special followers, but the group may include unusual and magical creatures; centaurs and werebears, for example, would be possible followers.

### Scrying Device Use (10th):

Rangers of 10th level or higher may use crystal balls and other such devices that permit magical scrying.

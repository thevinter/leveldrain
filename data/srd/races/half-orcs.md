The progeny of human/orc breeding are normally indistinguishable from orcs. However, a few are sufficiently human to gain levels in a character class, although they are severely limited in classes that do not focus upon violence and death.

Orcish blood runs strong in these half-breeds, and most of them are shifty, morally questionable, and unsophisticated. They are typically ugly, carrying the mark of orcish ancestry, but the same ancestry makes them deadly adversaries when the chips are down and the swords are out. Half-orcs can live to be 70 years old or older.

Humans are the standard for the game, and as such, humans have no unusual abilities or limitations in game terms. Because of their potential for unlimited progression in all the character classes save assassin and druid, humans are a popular choice for most players. This is an intentional feature of the rules.

A common house rule in OSRIC-compatible games is the adjustment or removal of demi-human level limits. This will unbalance the game in favour of demi-humans unless humans are given some corresponding advantage. GMs considering such a house rule for their own OSRIC-compatible games are advised to ensure that in most campaigns, humans should still represent an attractive choice for their players.

Dwarfs are a short and burly race, living in mountain fastnesses
underground. They are loyal friends and fierce adversaries,
known for their steadfastness in all things.
The dwarfs are inherently resistant to many spells and spell-like
effects. Dwarfish characters gain bonuses against the use of
most magic, including all spells, wands, rods, and staves. The
amount of the bonus depends upon the dwarfâ€™s constitution:
every 3.5 points of constitution (rounding down fractions)
grants a bonus of +1 against such magic. Moreover, the hardy
dwarfish nature imparts a similar bonus on any saving throws
against poison.
Dwarfs are not a numerous folk, but they are adventurous,
loving the lustre of gold, the glitter of gems, and the quality
of well-wrought metals. Dwarfs can live to an age of 350 years
or more.

Halflings are a small and unprepossessing race, often living
near human settlements at an agreeable remove from the bustle and hurriedness characteristic of humans. Halfling society
is comfortable and staid, rooted in polite, placid, well-fed life.
Halfling adventurers are thought aberrant, even lunatic, but
also dashing and heroic figures, a charming and amusing contradiction of logic.

Halflings value learning and craftsmanship, as long as nothing
is taken to an embarrassing extreme. They are capable of moving very quietly and are excellent marksmen; given the right
personality, halflings can become excellent thieves. Halflings
live to be 150 or more years old.

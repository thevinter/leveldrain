Elves are thinner and generally smaller in stature than humans.
The elves have a powerful bond with nature and do not have
souls; their thinking and motives are quite alien to those of
humankind, and in any dealings with elves, it is perilous to
forget this.

Some elven clans have built elaborate civilisations, remote and
beautiful places of profound learning, master craftsmanship, and
long history. Such elves tend to be chaotic good in alignment and
friendly, if aloof, from humans. More numerous are the wilder
elves, predominantly chaotic neutral in alignment and often not
friendly to other races, inclining even toward hostility.

Intruding into the territory of such elves is inadvisable, for their
sense of humour with regard to humans is, at best, arbitrary
and, at worst, cruel. Different as they are, these varied elven cultures all share the same racial abilities, unless the GM chooses
otherwise. Elves can live to an age of 1,000 years or more.

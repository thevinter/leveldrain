The caster becomes able to divine the presence of a particular kind of animal in the direction he or she views. The druid must concentrate for a full round in a particular direction in order to gain the insight granted by the spell. The spellâ€™s enchantment affects the caster, so the effects move with him or her. The divination is not blocked by any intervening substance, of any thickness.

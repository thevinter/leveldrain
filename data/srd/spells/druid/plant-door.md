This spell allows the druid to travel effortlessly through vegetation of any kind, stepping through it as if it did not exist. The pathway may also be travelled by a druid of higher level than the caster, but no other creature can take advantage of the spellâ€™s effect. The pathway opened by the spell may be up to 5 ft wide, 10 ft high, and up to 120 ft/ caster level in length. The druid may even use the spell to shift inside a tree or move through an area of plants affected by a spell (such as entangle). If the druid is within a tree that is attacked, he or she must leave the tree before it is killed or die with the tree.

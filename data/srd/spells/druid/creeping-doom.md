The terrifying creeping doom spell causes a massive swarm of insects, spiders, and centipedes to boil forth from the ground in front of the caster, marching in whatever direction he or she orders, destroying and killing all that stands in their way. The swarm is composed of (1d6+4) x100 non-flying vermin, each of which inflicts 1 hp damage against an opponent before dying. Only as many insects as are needed to kill an opponent will die, and once the target is dead the swarm will move on. If the druid allows the swarm to get more than 80 ft away from his or her person, 50 insects for every 10 ft beyond this range will depart the swarm. The druid can order the swarm to attack specific targets and/or to change direction. Although the spell can be devastating (potentially causing as much as 1,000 hp of damage in total), many means can be used to counter it â€” the most obvious being a fireball or other area-of-effect damage spell.

This spell causes up to 8 animals in the area of effect to grow to twice normal size, doubling their hit dice and the damage they inflict. The spell does not influence the animalsâ€™ attitude toward the druid, so it is advisable to ensure ahead of time that they are friendly. The reverse of the spell halves their size and damage inflicted.

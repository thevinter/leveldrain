The druid imbues a club or billet of oak-wood with enchanted power, making it +1 to hit and capable of infl icting 2d4 points of damage against small and medium-sized opponents, 1d4+1 against large opponents. The shillelagh must be wielded by the druid in order for it to possess these magical properties; in the hands of any other person it will be no more than an ordinary wooden club.

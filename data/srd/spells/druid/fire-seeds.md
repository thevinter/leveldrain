By casting this spell upon a group of seeds, either acorns or holly berries, the druid imbues them with the potential to erupt in a violent explosion of magical fire. Transformed acorns may be used as missiles, and transformed holly berries as delayed-action bombs. The spell allows the druid to create four acorn fire seeds or eight holly berry fire seeds, or a proportionate combination such as two acorns and four holly berries. Acorns may be thrown at a range of up to 40 ft and cause 2d8 points of damage in a radius of 5 ft, igniting any combustibles that fail item saving throws. If an acorn strikes its target with a successful to-hit roll, the target is not entitled to a saving throw. Even if the attack misses, the target may be caught in the blast area (and would be entitled to a saving throw for half damage, as any other creature within the blast area). The holly berries may be thrown no more than 6 ft, or may be left in place to ignite upon a command word. (The range of the command word is 40 ft.) Holly berries create an explosion in an area of 5 x 5 ft, inflicting 1d8 points of damage and causing combustible items to make saving throws against magical fire or burn. As with the acorn seeds, a successful saving throw against the explosion of a holly berry fire seed reduces the damage inflicted by one-half

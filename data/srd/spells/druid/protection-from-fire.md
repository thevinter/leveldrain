The druid may use this spell to confer considerable protection from fire upon another creature, but if he or she casts it upon him- or herself the effects are far greater, conferring temporary invulnerability even to fires of magical nature, such as dragonâ€™s breath. If the spell is cast upon another creature, the recipient gains immunity to normal fire and a saving throw bonus of +4 against fire based attacks. Any damage incurred by fire attacks will also reduced by half. If the spell is cast upon the druid, he or she becomes completely invulnerable to normal fire and also ignores all damage from magical fire (dragon breath, fireball, etc.) until a total of 12 hp/caster level has been absorbed by the spell, at which time the spell will be dissipated.

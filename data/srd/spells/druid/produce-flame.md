On casting this spell, the druidâ€™s hand ignites with an eldritch fire that causes no harm to the druid but is otherwise equivalent to the flame of a torch. It can be used to set fires and may also be thrown as a missile. The throwing range of the flame is 40 ft, and when the flame hits an object it will explode, igniting all combustible material in a radius of 15 ft. (Materials are entitled to saving throws against normal fire.) The druid may banish the magical flame at will, but fires set by it must be extinguished by normal means.

This spell causes creatures to behave strangely and unpredictably. A certain number of creatures in the spell’s area of effect must make a saving throw each round in order to avoid becoming confused. The base number of creatures is 2d4, but additional creatures may be affected; if the druid’s caster level is higher than the HD of the strongest opponent, the difference is the number of additional creatures that must make saving throws. This spell is extremely powerful; all saving throws are made with a penalty of –2. Creatures that fail their saving throws (check each round) act randomly in accordance with the following table:

| d%    | Action                                    |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 01-10 | Attacks the druid or his or her allies    |
| 11-20 | Acts normally                             |
| 21-50 | Babbles incoherently                      |
| 51-70 | Meanders away from caster for a full turn |
| 71-00 | Attacks nearest creature                  |

**Note:** a creature that meanders away is not entitled to further saving throws, but will be freed from the spell’s effects after taking a full turn of movement (at normal speed) away from the caster

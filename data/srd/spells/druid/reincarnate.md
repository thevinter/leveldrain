Provided that a body has been dead for no more than a week, a powerful druid can recall its spirit from the dead—but into another body. The form of the new body is not subject to the druid’s control, and is determined by means of the tables below. The new body will appear within 1d6 turns near the soul’s former body. Elves may be brought back to life by reincarnation. There is a 35% chance that the new incarnation will be from the “humanoid” table and a 65% chance that the new incarnation will be from the animal table. The new incarnation (if sapient) will retain the original character’s experience points, but will have new physical (Str, Dex, Con) ability scores randomly rolled and adjusted for the new race. The character will retain his or her original mental ability scores (Int, Wis, Cha).

This summoning calls certain woodland creatures to aid the druid, provided that they are nearby. The druid casts the spell by means of a sonorous chant, which he or she must continue for 2 turns or until the summoned creatures appear. The GM will determine if creatures that will respond to such a call are in the area. The creatures are entitled to a saving throw vs Spells (unlisted categories) at a penalty of –4. If the creatures fail the saving throw and are summoned to the druid’s aid, they will provide whatever aid they are capable of, although their willingness to engage in combat is subject to their overall reactions to the druid him- or herself.

If there is an evil character in the druid’s party, the summoned creatures gain an additional saving throw to avoid the effects of the spell, at a bonus of +4. Creatures that may be summoned by this spell include:

Centaurs 1d4
Pixies 1d8
Fauns 1d4
Treant 1
Unicorn 1

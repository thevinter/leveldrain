By means of this spell, the druid summons a 16 HD elemental from the plane of earth. The spell is otherwise identical to the druidic spell [Conjure Fire Elemental](/srd/spells/druid/conjure-fire-elemental), but there is no chance to summon a more powerful elemental, as exists when a druid summons fire elementals. As with conjuring fire elementals, the earth elemental will be the druidâ€™s ally by its own will; the druid requires no magical wards against it and need not concentrate upon it after the summoning is complete

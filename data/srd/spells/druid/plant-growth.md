By means of this spell, the druid causes plants and vines to grow with unbelievable speed, forming a tangled barrier of thick vegetation. The enchantment may be dispelled, or the plants cleared by normal means. Chopping a way through the barrier is possible, but movement is restricted to 10 ft/ turn (20 ft for size L creatures)

This spell is used to enchant a normal snare, making it hard to detect and supernaturally effective. The spell is cast upon a rope, vine, or cord, which then blends perfectly with the surroundings, becoming 90% undetectable to normal (unenchanted) vision. When any creature steps into the area bounded by the snare, the snare will whip closed and bind the victim tightly. Strength of 23 is required to break the snare for one hour after the spell is triggered, and the strength required falls by one point per hour until 12 hours have elapsed, at which time the spell ceases to have any effect. If the snare is attached to a suitably flexible tree, the spell will magically bend the tree so that when the trap is triggered it will snap the victim into the air for 1d6 points of damage and hold it suspended from the branches.

The fire storm invocation is a modifi ed and enlarged version of wall of fire. It lasts for only a single round, and does only half the damage of a wall of fire (i.e. 2d8 damage), but the huge area of effect makes it devastating.

The spellâ€™s reverse extinguishes all normal fire in the area of effect, or will instantly kill one fire elemental (no saving throw).

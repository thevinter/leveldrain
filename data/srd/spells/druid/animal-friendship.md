The animal friendship spell enchants a normal animal of neutral alignment to become the druid’s faithful friend and companion. The animal to be enchanted must not be completely unintelligent but cannot be of greater than animal intelligence. If the animal fails its saving throw (made at the beginning of the spell’s casting), it will remain docile for the remainder of the casting time. Once the spell is complete, the animal will remain with the druid and can learn tricks similar to those that could be taught to a well-trained domestic pet. Each trick takes a week to learn, and after the animal has been with the druid for three months it will no longer be able to learn new tricks. During this period, if the animal is left alone by the druid for more than three days, the enchantment will be broken and the animal will revert to the wild. A druid may only have animal friends with hit dice totalling twice his or her level. (The total hit dice can thus increase as the druid gains levels.)

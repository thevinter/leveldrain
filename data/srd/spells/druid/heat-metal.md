This extremely powerful spell causes metal to heat up to searing temperatures, and the reverse, chill metal, causes metal to become damagingly cold. The two versions of the spell inflict different damage and potential side effects. The effects of continued exposure to the metal as it changes temperature to a damaging level and then returns to normal are set forth below:

### Heat

**Round 1:** No effect other than discomfort
**Round 2:** 1d4 hp damage
**Rounds 3-5:** 2d4 hp damage, severe blistering to extremities (hands, feet), and unconsciousness if the metal is a helmet
**Round 6:** 1d4 hp damage
**Round 7:** Discomfort

### Cold

**Round 1:** no effect other than discomfort
**Round 2:** 1d2 hp damage
**Rounds 3-5:** 1d4 hp damage, severe frostbite (possible need for amputation of extremities such as fingers, ears)
**Round 6:** 1d4 hp damage
**Round 7:** discomfort

Immersion in water will negate the effects of the heat version of the spell, and magical protections against the appropriate elements will negate both versions. If no such options are available, the target of this spell is well advised to spend a round divesting him- or herself of metal gauntlets and helmet at the very least, to avoid the side effects.

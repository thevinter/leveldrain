This spell transforms solid rock into mud, the volume transformed being proportionate to the caster’s level. Any volume of mud will sink until its depth is equal to about one half the pool’s diameter. If this spell is cast upon a ceiling, the resulting volume of mud will immediately collapse, possibly trapping or suffocating those caught beneath. Similarly, if a floor is turned to mud, creatures standing in the area will sink and may be trapped. If dispel magic is cast upon the mud before it eventually dries into dirt, the mud will return to stone, but in the shape and location of the mud (i.e., a collapsed ceiling will not return to its original place; it will be frozen back into stone where it collapsed). The spell’s reverse transforms mud into sandstone or a similar sedimentary rock.

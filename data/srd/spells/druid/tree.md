Casting this spell causes the druid’s shape to melt and twist into that of a tree, its general appearance determined by the caster. The spell is neither an illusion nor a charm: the druid is, for all intents and purposes, a tree. However, in tree shape the druid retains human senses and will be fully aware of his or her surroundings. The druid may shift back into human shape at will, thereby ending the spell. Magical detections will reveal the druid’s true form, but ordinary inspections, no matter how minute, will not.

One of the more dramatic examples of druidic magic is the wall of fi re spell, by which the druid calls up a blazing inferno of flame in the shape of a wall. One side of the confl agration emits the searing heat one would expect, but the other side emits merely a gentle warmth. Passing through the flames inflicts 4d4 damage plus 1/caster level. Creatures as far as ten ft from the hot side of the wall incur 2d4 hit points of damage, and even creatures as far as 20 ft from the fi re are burned for 1d4 points of damage. Undead creatures suffer worse from the power of this druidic magic, taking twice the ordinary damage the wall would inflict.

The wall persists for as long as the druid concentrates upon
it, or, if the druid does not choose to maintain concentration,
will remain for 1 round/ caster level. The druid may evoke a
wall of fire in one of two shapes: a wall or a ring. The size of
a straight wall is up to one 20 ft square per caster level. A ring
has a radius of up to five ft per caster level (with the caster in
the centre) and is 20 ft high. If the druid manifests the spell
as a wall, the effect is stationary. The ring-shaped wall moves
with the caster.

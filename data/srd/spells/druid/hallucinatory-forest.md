By casting this spell, the druid creates the illusion of a forest in the spell’s area of effect. Woodland fey and other druids will immediately discern the forest’s illusory nature, but even normal animals will be fooled by the forest’s appearance. The illusion is not tactile, only visual, so it is likely that intelligent beings entering the forest will quickly realize they are walking in an illusion. However, the mere realization that the forest is not real does not dispel the illusion, and it will continue to limit vision and possibly create other inconveniences; horses, for example, will not walk a straight path through the illusion, circling around the “trees” they perceive as real.

An invisible barrier forms around the spellâ€™s recipient as the caster completes the invocation, warding him or her from insects. Only true insects are affected by the spell, which does not repel spiders, scorpions, beetles or centipedes. Normal insects are completely hedged out by the spell, and giant varieties (2+ HD) must succeed in a saving throw against spells to pass the barrier. Even if a giant insect should manage to penetrate the barrier, it will sustain 1d6 hit points of damage from doing so.

By means of this spell, the druid steps into one tree and steps out from a distant tree of the same type. The druid determines the direction in which he or she will travel from one tree to another. Most trees permit a maximum distance of travel of 300 yards, but trees sacred to druids allow travel of considerably greater distance; oak, yew, and rowan trees permit the druid to travel as far as 600 yards. If no tree of the same type is to be found in the direction the druid designates, he or she will emerge from any tree of that species within the spell’s range closest to the direction he or she specified. The druid may remain in the first tree for as long as one round per caster level before being forced to leave the other tree, and in this case he or she will be treated in the same way as for a plant door spell. If no appropriate tree is available for the druid to step from, he or she may remain in the first tree for the spell’s duration, but will not be able to use the spell for travelling

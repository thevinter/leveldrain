A chariot of fire, drawn by two fl aming steeds, appears with an echoing thunderclap when the druid completes the final words of this spell. The druid may, by touch, make up to 8 of his or her companions immune to the furnace-like conveyance; anyone else within five ft of the horses or the chariot will sustain 2d4 hp of damage per round. The chariot can travel over land at a speed of 240 ft/ round and can fly at a speed of 480 ft/ round, obeying the caster’s shouted instructions. It is possible for the chariot and horses to sustain damage from magical weapons or from water (which does only 1 hp of damage). Chariot and horses each have 30 hp and are AC 2; if a single horse is dispelled by taking physical damage, the chariot’s speed will be halved. The chariot prevents normal fire from affecting its passengers, but they may take damage from magical fi re attacks. The chariot and horses are themselves immune to all fire, magical or otherwise.

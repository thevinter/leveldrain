A hold animal spell completely immobilises up to four animals (i.e. creatures listed under “animal” in Chapter IV) for the length of the spell’s duration. The druid decides how many animals he or she will target with the spell: if there is only one target, the saving throw is made at –4; if two, each makes the saving throw at –2; if three, the saving throw is at –1; and if the druid seeks to hold four animals, each makes its saving throw with no penalty. Animals held by this spell may be killed or bound at a rate of one per round, or, if the attacker chooses, may be attacked at twice the normal rate with an automatic hit, for maximum damage.

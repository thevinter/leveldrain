This spell affects plants that can move, whether naturally or as the result of a spell. Plants affected by the spell are frozen in place for the spell’s duration, and if the spell is cast upon normal vegetation (such as dry leaves), these will make no sound other than sounds caused by the wind. In the case of moulds, fungi, and other plants that cannot be considered separately, the spell affects 4-16 square yards of space, as decided by the druid. In the case of plant creatures such as treants, the spell affects between one and four creatures, at the caster’s option.

Depending upon how many creatures (or sq yards of space) the druid targets, the saving throw against the spell is subject to different penalties. If one creature (4 sq yards) is targeted, the saving throw against the spell is made at a penalty of –4; two creatures or 8 sq yards suffer a penalty of –2; three creatures or 12 sq yards suffer a penalty of –1; and four creatures or 16 sq yards suffer no penalty on the saving throw

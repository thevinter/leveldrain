A druid may use this spell to summon normal or giant animals of a specified type. The animals must be within the spell’s range to be summoned. Up to three summoning attempts may be made if animals of the specified type do not appear. Assuming that the summoned type of animal is within the spell’s range, up to 8 animals will appear, of no more than 4 hit dice each. These animals will assist the druid with a specific mission: winning a battle, travelling to a specific location, etc.

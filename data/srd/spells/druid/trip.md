This spell turns an appropriate object into a magical trap of sorts. The object rises from the ground and trips any creature crossing over it, even if they are aware of it (saving throw vs spellsâ€”unlisted category, +4 if aware of the object). The object is 80% undetectable and will affect even the caster. The trap causes falls to be much worse than normal: a running creature will suffer 1d6 points of damage and be stunned for 1d4+1 rounds, or will merely be stunned if they fall onto a soft surface such as grass. Creatures larger than size M are not affected by the spell.

The druid uses this spell to ignite a fiery-looking aura of bright light around his or her enemies. The aura is visible at a range of 80 ft if the observer stands in darkness, and at 40 ft if he or she stands near another light source. The light itself is harmless, but a creature limned with faerie fire is easier to hit; any attacks against it are made with a bonus of +2

The caster creates a personal nightmare creature for the spell’s victim, drawn from the victim’s own worst fears. The creature is visible only to the victim and the caster. When the phantasmal killer takes shape, the victim is entitled to roll 3d6 and compare the result to his or her intelligence ability score. If the die roll is less than the victim’s intelligence, the victim realizes that the killer is actually an illusion and cannot be harmed by it. Certain modifi ers apply to this roll (note that a negative modifi er increases the chance for successfully disbelieving the apparition):

(A) –2 if the target is an illusionist;

(B) +1 if the target is caught by surprise;

(C) –1 if the target has previously been attacked by a phantasmal killer.

The wisdom bonus against mental attacks applies (subtract the bonus from the die roll instead of adding it, of course).

Provided that the victim fails his or her saving throw, the phantasmal killer proceeds to attack as a 4 HD monster. If it hits the target, he or she will automatically die from fright. The apparition is not vulnerable to damage and cannot be escaped. It disappears at the end of the spell’s duration, or at any time the caster dismisses it, or when the caster is killed or rendered unconscious.

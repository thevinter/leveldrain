The illusionist’s outline becomes blurred, as if seen through shimmering waves of heat. In consequence, the illusionist gains a bonus of +1 against any targeted magical attack. Additionally, any opponent’s first attack against the illusionist will incur a penalty of –4, and subsequent attacks incur a penalty of –2 (after one attack, the opponent has become accustomed to the spell’s distorting effect).

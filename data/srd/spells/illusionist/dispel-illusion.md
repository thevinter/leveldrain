This spell automatically dispels phantasmal forces cast by nonillusionists. All other illusion spells are treated as if this spell were a [Dispel Magic](/srd/spells/illusionist/dispel-magic) (i.e., with a 50% base chance to dispel, adjusted up or down by 2% or 5% respectively, based on relative caster levels).

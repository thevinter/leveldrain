This spell functions in the same manner as [Improved Phantasmal Force](/srd/spells/illusionist/improved-phantasmal-force), but it is a more powerful evocation of the same magic. The illusionist can include sounds, smells, and heat (or cold) into the illusion, making it very believable. The spectral force can linger for 3 rounds after the illusionist ceases to concentrate upon it.

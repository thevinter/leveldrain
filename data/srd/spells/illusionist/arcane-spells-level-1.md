This spell enables the illusionist to memorise several first level magic user spells in place of one seventh level illusionist spell. The illusionist may substitute a number of magic user spells equal to his or her level minus ten (4 at 14th level, 5 at 15th level, etc.). The mage spells must be chosen at the same time as the Arcane Spells, Level 1 spell is memorised.

The illusionist traces magical patterns in the air with a lit stick of incense or other small light source. Any creature in the area of effect that looks at the traceries of light must make a saving throw or stay transfi xed by the patterns. The spell can affect a maximum of 25 hit dice worth of creatures, and its effect persists for so long as the caster chooses to continue tracing the patterns in the air.

This spell allows the illusionist to “cast” a quasi-real version of any one of the following arcane spells: cloudkill, cone of cold, magic missile, fireball, lighting bolt, wall of fire, wall of ice. If a victim fails a saving throw vs spells, the illusion will function as a real version of that spell with regard to the victim. If the saving throw is successful, it will still have a lessened effect due to its quasi-real nature. The offensive spells will infl ict 2 hit points per caster level, the wall spells will inflict 1d4 hit points per caster level, and the cloudkill will only kill creatures of fewer than 2 hit dice (no saving throw)

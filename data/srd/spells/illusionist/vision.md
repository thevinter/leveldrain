By means of this spell, the illusionist gazes beyond reality itself, seeking patterns that will give him or her the answer to a question. 3d6 are rolled, and if the result is 10 or higher, he or she gains significant insights about the answer to the question. Gazing into the patterns beyond reality is a risky proposition, however; if the result of the die roll is from 2-6, the illusionist becomes obsessed with performing a task, and is treated as being under a geas spell until the random task is completed. If the roll is from 7-9 there is no result at all from the divination; the illusionist discerns no useful patterns, and suffers no ill effects from the attempt

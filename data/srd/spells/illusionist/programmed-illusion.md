This spell specifies a particular trigger event (in the same manner as the magic user spell [Magic Mouth](/srd/spells/magic-user/magic-mouth)). When the trigger event occurs, an illusion prepared in advance by the caster, identical to a spectral force, comes into being. The illusion lasts 1 round/ caster level.

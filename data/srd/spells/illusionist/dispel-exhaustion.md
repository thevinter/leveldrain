This spell creates a powerful illusion of physical health. Recipients “gain” 50% of any hit points that have been lost, and function for all intents and purposes as if these hit points are real. The illusory hit points are the first to be subtracted if the character sustains damage. At the end of the spell’s duration, the remaining illusory hit points are lost. Additionally, any character under the influence of this spell can move (but not attack) at double the normal speed.

This spell causes a number of creatures in the spell’s area of effect to behave strangely and unpredictably. All creatures in the spell’s area of effect become confused (see below for effect), and only illusionists, fi ghters, and creatures with an intelligence of 4 or lower are entitled to a saving throw at all. Those entitled to a saving throw must check each round to avoid becoming confused. Creatures that fail their saving throws (if entitled to one at all) act randomly in accordance with the following table:

| d%    | Action                                       |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 01-10 | Attacks the illusionist or his or her allies |
| 11-20 | Acts normally                                |
| 21-50 | Babbles incoherently                         |
| 51-70 | Meanders away from caster for a full turn    |
| 71-00 | Attacks nearest creature                     |

**Note:** A creature that meanders away is not entitled to further
saving throws, but will be freed from the spell’s effects after
taking a full turn of movement (at normal speed) away from
the caster.

A certain number of creatures within the spellâ€™s area of effect are frozen in place, magically convinced that they cannot move. The caster can affect creatures with a total number of hit dice equal to twice his caster level. Each creature is entitled to a saving throw against the spell. The illusionist can end the paralysis at any time; otherwise a dispel magic (or dispel illusion) spell is the only way to remove the paralysis.

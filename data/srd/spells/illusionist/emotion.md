By casting this spell, the illusionist is able to instil others with one of four powerful emotions, each with a different effect, as described below:

**Fear:** If the illusionist chooses to instil fear, the spell’s effect is similar to that of the fear spell, but with a –2 penalty applied to saving throws.
**Hate:** If the illusionist instils hate, the targets gain a +2 to saving throws, attacks, and damage.
**Hopelessness:** The illusionist causes despair in the target creatures, who will wander sadly away or surrender in the face of a challenge such as a combat.
**Rage:** Creatures affected by rage attack at +1, gain a damage bonus of +3, and gain a bonus of 5 temporary hit points. Temporary hit points are lost fi rst if the creature incurs damage. The affected creature will not willingly retreat from any combat or any opponent.

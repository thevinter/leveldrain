The gestures of this spell weave a hypnotic power into the illusionistâ€™s words, affecting 1d6 creatures. Those not making their saving throws are subject to a suggestion made by the illusionist, identical to that made in the magic user spell suggestion (but with a much shorter duration). The only indication about whether a creature has been affected by the hypnotism is whether or not it responds to the suggestion.

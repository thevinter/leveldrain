With a small piece of material, the caster may use this spell to create an object made of that same material. The base material cannot be alive and must come from a plant. Thus, within the caster’s limits on the item’s volume, he or she could create a basket from a piece of straw, a door or club from a splinter of wood, a cloak from a piece of wool, etc. The item exists only for the duration of the spell.

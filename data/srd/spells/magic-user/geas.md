A _geas_ is a magical compulsion placed upon an intelligent creature to perform, or refrain from performing, some task set by the caster. While the _geas_ cannot compel suicide or its equivalent, it is a very powerful spell. If the creature under the _geas_ avoids or is prevented from performing the task, it will sicken and die within 1d4 weeks if the task is not resumed. The disease will, of course, create symptoms that the GM will determine; if the _geas_ is resumed, these may or may not remain until the task is completed. Even a remove curse spell will not remove a _geas_, although a [wish](/srd/spells/magic-user/wish) spell is powerful enough to dispel it.

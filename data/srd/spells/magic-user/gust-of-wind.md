Hand outstretched in the final somatic gesture of this spell, the magic user summons forth a powerful blast of air, forceful enough to blow out unprotected flames smaller than a campfire. Flames the size of a campfire or greater will flare back as far as 1d6 ft, and even shielded flames have a high chance of being extinguished (5% per caster level). The wind is strong enough to hurl a small flying creature backwards by 1d6 x 10 ft, and will hold medium-sized creatures back from moving.

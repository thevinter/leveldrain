A [delayed blast fireball] is somewhat more powerful than a normal [fireball](/srd/spells/magic-user/fireball) (+1 damage on each die). At the time of casting, the magic user states an amount of time, from 1 segment (6 seconds) to 5 rounds (5 minutes), and the fireball will not explode until that time is reached. Otherwise, except as noted above, the spell functions as per the description of the [fireball](/srd/spells/magic-user/fireball) spell.

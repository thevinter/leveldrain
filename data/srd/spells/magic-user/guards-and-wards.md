This powerful spell is primarily used to defend the caster’s stronghold. The ward protects 200 square ft per caster level. The warded area can be as much as 20 ft high and shaped as the caster desires. The magic user can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; he or she must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area: 

**Fog:** Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including infravision, beyond 10 ft. 

**Wizard locks:** All doors in the warded area are wizard locked. 

Webs: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical to those created by the web spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the guards and wards spell lasts. 

**Confusion:** Where there are choices in direction—such as a corridor intersection or side passage—a minor confusion-type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is an enchantment/charm effect that will not affect elves or other creatures immune to charm. 

**Lost doors:** One door per caster level is covered by an illusion to appear as if it were a plain wall. 

In addition, the magic user can place his or her choice of one of the following five magical effects: 

1. Dancing lights in four corridors. 

2. A magic mouth in two places. 

3. A stinking cloud in two places. The vapours return within 10 turns if dispersed by wind while the guards and wards spell lasts. 

4. A gust of wind in one corridor or room. 

5. A suggestion in one place. The caster selects an area of up to 5 ft square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally. The whole warded area radiates strong magic. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

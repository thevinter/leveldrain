This quickly-shouted spell holds fast a door or similar aperture as if it were securely locked. The portal must be something that normally opens and closes, such as a door, gate, valve, or portcullis, and it must be closed for the spell to function. A magically held portal can be battered apart, but will not open normally until the spellâ€™s duration expires. This is not a particularly powerful spell; any being not native to the material planes (such as a demon) will ignore its effects, as will a magic user four or more levels higher than the caster. The spell may also be negated by means of a [knock](/srd/spells/magic-user/knock) or [dispel magic](/srd/spells/cleric/dispel-magic).

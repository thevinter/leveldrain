The *mirror image* spell creates 1d4 phantasmal images of the magic user, all mirroring his or her actions. The spell’s 6ft radius also becomes slightly blurred to sight, like the reflection of a slightly distorted mirror. The combination of these two magical phenomena makes it impossible to distinguish the images from the caster without aid of a magical nature, such as true seeing. When an opponent makes a successful hit against one of the images, the image breaks up and disappears (the others remain). If an opponent attempts to attack a magic user obscured by this spell, it is randomly determined whether the to-hit roll is directed toward the person or one of the images. At the end of the spell’s duration, the images fade from sight.

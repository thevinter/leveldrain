This spell affects an area or an object with a magical aura that repels or attracts a certain, specified type of being. Either a race of creature or an alignment must be specified Note that if the spell is cast upon an object rather than an area, the targeted type of creature will have a penalty of –2 on the saving throw. If the magic user creates an antipathy for the area or object, the targeted creature type will feel an intense desire to stay away from it. A saving throw applies, permitting the creature to remain, or to touch the object, but even if the saving throw is successful the creature will feel extremely uncomfortable in its presence. Creatures that are able to remain in the area or near the object will begin to lose 1 point of dexterity per round (maximum 4 points) from discomfort.

If the magic user creates sympathy for an object or area, on the other hand, the targeted creature type will feel attracted to the area or object, pleased to remain in the vicinity, or covetous of the “precious” item. If the creature does not make a saving throw, it will do whatever is in its power to stay in contact with the area or the enchanted object.

The caster’s magic words cause an object to vanish, either being teleported away or shifted into the æthereal plane and replaced with stone on the material plane. The caster can teleport an object that weighs no more than 50 lbs per caster level to a location of his or her choice (subject to the normal rules of a teleport spell). If the object is larger, or if the caster chooses not to change its location, he may instead shift the object into the æthereal plane, to be replaced with shapeless stone. A dispel magic cast upon such stone will return the object to the material plane. Items that are part of larger structures, such as doors or windows, may be caused to vanish.

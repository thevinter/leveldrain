By means of this spell, the caster reduces him- or herself to a two-dimensional sheet with no third dimension. He or she can fit through the thinnest of spaces provided they are large enough to accommodate his or her remaining two dimensionsâ€”he or she cannot bend down while two-dimensional. Moreover, he or she can become invisible by the simple expedient of turning sideways. While two-dimensional, the caster can move, cast spells, and otherwise act normally. If attacked from the front or back, however, he or she takes three times normal damage. Casting the spell requires expensive material components of (1d4+4)x1,000 gp in value.

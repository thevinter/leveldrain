This spell creates a false magical aura around a single object of not more than five lbs per caster level. A [detect magic spell](/srd/spells/magic-user/detect-magic) spell will incorrectly perceive the item as magical, but if it is actually handled by the caster of the [detect magic spell](/srd/spells/magic-user/detect-magic), he or she will be permitted a saving throw to realize that the aura is, in fact, not a true magical aura but a counterfeit.

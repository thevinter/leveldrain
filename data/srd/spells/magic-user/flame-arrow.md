By means of this spell, the magic user may enchant one arrow per segment, causing it to burst into normal flame. The enchanted arrows have no bonus to hit, and the enchantment is not powerful enough to hit a creature that can be damaged only by magical weapons. Each arrow causes 1 hp of fire damage in addition to its normal damage. The arrows (or crossbow bolts) will burn up in one round, so they must be shot before this time.

This spell disintegrates matter of any kind: animal, vegetable, or mineral. Matter of a magical nature will also be destroyed, although evocations of magic force (such as a [wall of force](/srd/spells/magic-user/wall-of-force), [globe of invulnerability](/srd/spells/magic-user/globe-of-invulnerability), or [shield](/srd/spells/magic-user/shield)) are not affected (not being matter). An entire creature, or an area of non-living matter up to 10 x 10 ft/level, will be utterly obliterated by this powerful spell. The spell cannot be used to destroy both living and nonliving matter; once it hits its first target it will take effect upon that matter and not pass beyond.

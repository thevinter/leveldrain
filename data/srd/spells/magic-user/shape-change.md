Upon casting this spell, the magic user becomes able to change shape almost at will (each change takes one segment, and incurs no system shock check). The caster retains his or her own mind and hit points, but assumes the magical properties of the shape-changed form as well as its physical capabilities. The spell does not allow the caster to assume the form of any greater creature native to another plane of existence, but virtually any other form can be assumed, from a tree to an insect to a treasure chest to a dragon. The material component of the spell is a piece of jewellery worth 5,000 gp

The *incendiary cloud* begins as a choking cloud of thick smoke, with the attributes of a [pyrotechnics](/srd/spells/druid/pyrotechnics) spell’s smoke cloud, billowing from an existing fire source as per the [pyrotechnics](/srd/spells/druid/pyrotechnics) spell. The cloud has a radius of 20 ft and is 10 ft high. On the third round of the cloud’s existence, it bursts into hot, magical flame. A saving throw for half damage is permitted to every creature in the cloud for each round of exposure to the flames. 

In the first round of the flare, the blazing cloud inflicts one hit point of damage for every two levels of the caster. In the second round of the flare, the heat increases to inflict 1 hit point per caster level, and in the third round of the blaze, damage falls again to one point per two levels. After three rounds, the cloud burns out, and for any further duration it retains only the properties of pyrotechnic smoke.

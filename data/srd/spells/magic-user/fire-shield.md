Pale flames envelope the caster upon the completion of this spell, rendering him or her protection against either fire or cold based attacks, depending upon whether the magic user elects to wreath him- or herself in cold flame or hot flame. Cold flame grants the magic user a +2 bonus on any saving throw vs fire damage, also guaranteeing half damage (or no damage against all fire attacks that allow a saving throw for half damage) provided the saving throw is successful. If the magic user fails a saving throw against a cold based attack, however, he or she will suffer twice the normal damage. Hot flame offers the converse of the protections afforded by cold flame. Cold based attacks receive a bonus of +2 on saving throws and guarantee that the caster receives only half damage (or none at all) if his or her saving throw is successful against attacks that would cause full or half damage.

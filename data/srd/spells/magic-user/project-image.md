This spell creates an illusory duplicate of the magic user in another place within the spell’s range. The image must remain visible to the caster or the spell will end. Much like a mirror image, the projected image mimics all the caster’s movements, but it is not affected by attacks of any kind. The image possesses an arcane link to the caster; if desired, the magic user can cast spells that originate at the image rather than at the caster, as if the image, rather than the magic user, cast the spell. Thus, the effective range of an attack spell can be increased, or a spell that would ordinarily centre on the caster could be brought into effect around the projected image.

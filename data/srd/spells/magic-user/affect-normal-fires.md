With arcane words and gestures, the magic user may command small fires, up to a limit of 1½ ft in radius, to grow smaller or larger. Any fire within the spell’s size limitations may be made as small as a candle flame or turned into a bonfire up to 3 ft in diameter. An affected fire only consumes fuel appropriate to its new size, but will continue to radiate the same heat as a fire of its original size

With arcane words and gestures, the magic user may command small fi res, up to a limit of 1½ ft in radius, to grow smaller or larger. Any fi re within the spell’s size limitations may be made as small as a candle fl ame or turned into a bonfi re up to 3 ft in diameter. An affected fi re only consumes fuel appropriate to its new size, but will continue to radiate the same heat as a fi re of its original size

The teleport spell permits the caster to transport him- or herself, and any additional weight he or she can carry, instantly from one place to another. The magic user must be familiar with the destination (see below), but there is no effective range to the spell, although it does not permit travel to other planes.

| Familiarity       | On Target | Off Target | Similar Area | Mishap |
| ----------------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------ |
| Very familiar     | 01–97     | 98–99      | 100          | —      |
| Studied carefully | 01–94     | 95–97      | 98–99        | 100    |
| Seen casually     | 01–88     | 89–94      | 95–96        | 97–100 |
| Viewed once       | 01–76     | 77–88      | 89–90        | 99–100 |
| False destination | (1d20+80) | —          | 81–92        | 93–100 |

To see how well the teleportation works, the player will roll d% and consult the preceding table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms contained in table:

**Familiarity:** “Very familiar” is a place where the caster has been very often and feels at home. “Studied carefully” is a place the caster knows well, either because he or she can currently see it, has been there often, or has used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour. “Seen casually” is a place that the caster has seen more than once but with which he or she is not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that the caster has seen once, possibly using magic. “False destination” is a place that does not truly exist, or if the caster is teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such, or has been so completely altered as to no longer be considered “familiar.”

When travelling to a false destination, the player rolls 1d20+80 on the table rather than rolling d%, as there is no real destination.

**On Target:** The caster appears in the correct location.

**Off Target:** The caster appears safely, a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be travelled. The direction off target is determined randomly

**Similar Area:** The caster winds up in an area that is visually or thematically (depending on how the caster identifi ed it while casting) similar to the target area. It is possible (25% chance) that this result will indicate that the correct location has been reached but that the caster and party will arrive too high, falling 1d% ft unless there is means to arrest the fall. If the party arrives too high and the result would entomb them in a solid surface, they die instantly. Generally, the caster will appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails.

**Mishap:** The caster and anyone else teleporting with him or her arrive beneath the destination point, causing instant death if the area is solid.

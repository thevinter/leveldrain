Clairvoyance, together with clairaudience, is one of the classic “scrying” spells—spells that allow the caster to extend his or her perception and senses far into the distance to spy upon enemies and scout locations. Clairvoyance is a means of seeing events in a distant location. There is no effective limit to the spell’s range, but the location must either be familiar to the caster or be obvious, such as the top floor inside a tower the caster can see, or just beyond a dungeon door.

The spell cannot penetrate metal; sheets of any type of metal between the caster and the target area will prevent the magic user from being able to scry upon the area. The caster will be able to hear sounds in a 10 ft radius of the spell’s focal point even if the area is dark. If the area is not dark, the caster will be able to see as if he or she were standing at the spell’s focal point, for a normal distance but in all directions at once (for the vision is in his or her mind’s eye).

The spell cannot be used to scry across planes of existence; it is limited to locations in the same plane in which it is cast.

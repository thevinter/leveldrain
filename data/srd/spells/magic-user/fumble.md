This enchantment causes intense clumsiness in the affected creature. Attempting to run will result in an immediate fall to a prone position, and anything held in hand (or claw, etc.) will be dropped. A successful saving throw allows the affected creature to act as if under the influence of a slow spell in order to avoid the spellâ€™s full effects.

This eerie spell creates a true, living duplicate of a creature, grown in a vat in the magic userâ€™s laboratory and matured rapidly to adulthood. The clone has the level, the experience points, and the memories of the original person as of the time a piece of that person was obtained for the purpose of making a clone. If a clone and its original exist simultaneously, the magical flux of such a situation can drive either or both of them insane. Each will seek to destroy the other with an uncontrollable sense that something is horribly wrong while both exist.

If the situation persists, the clone is 70% likely to go insane, a 20% chance that the original will go insane, and a 5% chance that both will become insane, with a 5% chance that both will somehow accept that they co-exist.

It takes 2d4 months for the caster to grow the clone in his vats before it becomes a true duplicate of the original. If the process of vat-growth is interrupted prematurely, the clone will be utterly insane, hating all living things, and may become psychotic.

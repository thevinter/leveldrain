This spell enables the magic user to cloak him- or herself in the physical shape of another creature, and to continue shapeshifting at will for the length of the spell’s duration. The transformation is of an entirely lesser order than that of polymorph other, incurring no risk of a system shock or of truly becoming the transformed creature. Changing from one shape to another requires only 30 seconds, and when the caster returns to his or her original form (ending the spell) he or she will be healed of 1d12 points of any damage infl icted against the polymorphed forms he or she assumed.

The caster can polymorph into forms no smaller than a songbird and no heavier than 2,000 lbs. Only the movement capabilities of the new form can be used, not its attacks, defences, or other abilities. The magic user can transform him- or herself into a lion, and run as fast as a lion, but his or her claws will do no more damage than a human’s soft fi sts. Similarly, if he or she transforms into a dragon, he or she will have the dragon’s ability to fly but no breath weapon. As an orc, he or she would be able to use whatever weapons he or she could use in his original shape, but would lack infravision. The caster retains his or her own hit points and armour class.

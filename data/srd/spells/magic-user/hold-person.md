This spell has the same effect as the clerical spell [hold person](/srd/spells/cleric/hold-person): to immobilise foes and render them helpless. However, the magic user’s version of the spell is somewhat more flexible in terms of the caster’s options. A hold person spell completely immobilises up to four man-sized or smaller persons for the spell’s duration. The magic user decides how many of his or her foes he or she will target with the spell: if there is only one target, the saving throw is made at –3, if two, each makes the saving throw at –1, and if the magic user seeks to hold three or four enemies, each makes his or her saving throw with no penalty. 

Creatures affected by this spell would include humans, demihumans and humanoids. Ultimately, it is in the discretion of the GM to decide if a creature is considered a “person” for the purposes of this spell. If a magic item or spell operates to partially negate the effects of paralysis, failure on the saving throw will have the effect of a slow spell rather than completely immobilising the target. 

Persons held by this spell may be killed or bound at a rate of one per round, or, if the attacker chooses, may be attacked at twice the normal rate with an automatic hit, for maximum damage.

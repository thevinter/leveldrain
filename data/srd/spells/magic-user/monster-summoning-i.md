By casting this spell, the magic user conjures up 2-8 monsters to serve him or her as allies in combat or to perform other services. The monsters appear from thin air within 1d4 rounds of the spell’s completed casting. If the caster is in combat, the monsters will fight on his or her behalf, attacking whatever foes he directs, or guarding him or her. For more complex tasks, the magic user must somehow have the ability to communicate these more specific commands. The GM has the ultimate discretion as to what monsters will appear, but the general likelihood is described below:

| d6 | Monster Summoned             |
|----|------------------------------|
| 1  | Rat, giant                   |
| 2  | Goblin (dwarf)               |
| 3  | Hobgoblin (elf)              |
| 4  | Kobold (halfling)            |
| 5  | Orc (gnome)                  |
| 6  | Demon, manes (badger, giant) |

Evil casters may get the monsters in parentheses, at the GM’s
option.

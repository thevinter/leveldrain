This spell grants the magic user the ability to communicate with (for a period of 1 turn) and command plants (the obedience is permanent) in the spell’s area of effect. No unusual abilities are granted to the plants; they have no additional capabilities beyond those they had before the spell was cast. Only intelligent plants are entitled to a saving throw, but at a penalty of –4.

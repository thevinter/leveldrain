This spell allows the caster to move objects through force of will, up to a weight limit of 25 lbs per level. An object can be accelerated to a deadly velocity over the course of a few minutes. The base speed is 20 ft/ round, but the caster can double this speed every round (to 40 ft, then 80 ft, then 160 ft) to a maximum of 102,400 ft/ round (1,706 ft/ second). For every 2,000 ft/ round that an object is travelling, it will sustain 1d6 damage if it strikes another object. The spell allows an object to be moved in any direction, horizontally or vertically.

This spell causes a bubble of magical force to form around the caster. The field will extend through solid substances if necessary, providing a complete sphere of protection even against burrowing creatures. When the caster stands on the ground, the sphere will thus appear to be a hemisphere, with half of it beneath the ground. The field’s outside surface is not transparent and is usually a dark amber colour, but anyone inside the sphere can see through to the outside as if the force field did not exist. The spell provides protection against inclement winds and temperature within a certain range, but offers no protection against attacks from outside. Anyone can pass into and out of the hut, and up to 6 medium-sized or 8 small creatures can shelter inside with the caster. If the caster leaves the hut, the spell ends.

Inside the hut, the inhabitants will not feel winds of up to 50 mph, which are completely blocked by the bubble of force, but if the wind reaches gale force of 50 mph the tiny hut will be shredded into oblivion. The temperature inside the hut remains at a pleasant 70˚ Fahrenheit for so long as the outside temperature remains in a range from 0˚ to 100˚. For every degree of outside temperature beyond this range, the temperature inside the hut will rise or fall accordingly from 70˚. The caster may illuminate the inside of the hut with a dim, ambient light that will not, of course, show to the outside.

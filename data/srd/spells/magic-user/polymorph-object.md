This spell allows the magic user to transform one thing, living or not, into another sort of thing. If the spell is used simply to duplicate the effects of a polymorph other spell or a stone to flesh spell, it will function in the same manner as these spells but with a –4 penalty to the victim’s saving throw. Otherwise, the spell’s duration depends upon the degree of change involved in the transformation. The calculation is made using a “duration factor” found on table 1, and the explanation of the resulting duration factor is found on table 2.

| Changed Subject Is:                                  | Increase to Duration Factor |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Same kingdom (animal, vegetable, mineral)            | +5                          |
| Same class (mammals, fungi, metals, etc.)            | +2                          |
| Same size                                            | +2                          |
| Related (twig is to tree, wolf fur is to wolf, etc.) | +2                          |
| Same or lower intelligence                           | +2                          |

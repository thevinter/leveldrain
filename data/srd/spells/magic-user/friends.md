This spell increases the magic user’s charisma in the eyes of all creatures within the area of effect that fail saving throws. For these creatures, the magic user’s charisma will effectively be increased by 2d4 (one roll for all). For those who succeed in making the saving throw, the caster’s charisma will effectively be lowered by 1d4. 

Unless the exact numbers are required for some purpose, the normal result of the spell will be that those who failed the saving throw will be well-disposed and friendly toward the caster, and those that succeeded in making the save will find him or her distasteful and somewhat suspect.

This spell creates a nauseating cloud of vapours to billow forth in a location chosen by the caster. All creatures caught within (or later entering) the noxious cloud must make saving throws. Any creature failing to save will be completely unable to act for 1d4+1 rounds, falling to the ground retching and gagging (treated as stunned). A creature that succeeds in making the saving throw may move from within the cloud and be free of the effects after only one round of gasping fresh air (again, being treated as stunned for this round). Even creatures that succeed in making a saving throw cannot do anything within the cloud other than to leave as fast as possible

This spell allows the caster to overhear the surface thoughts of any thinking being in the spellâ€™s radial area of effect. The caster need not be able to see the creature whose thoughts he is reading; the spell can be used to listen beyond a closed door. The spell cannot penetrate more than two ft of stone or more than two inches of any metal, and it is foiled by even a thin sheet of lead.

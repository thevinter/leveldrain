This spell allows the subject to make one or more prodigious leaps, one additional leap for each three caster levels above 1. Thus, at a caster level of 4, the spell permits a second leap, with additional leaps at level 7, 10, 13, etc. The recipient of the spell may bound forward 30 ft, or may leap backward or straight up for a distance of 10 ft. The leap is almost perfectly straight, with no arc.

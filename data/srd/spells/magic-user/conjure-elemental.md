By means of this spell, the magic user calls an elemental being from the plane of air, fire, earth or water to do his or her bidding. The particular form of elemental to be summoned is a part of the spell’s incantation, so the magic user must memorise the spell for a particular element. The magic user exerts control over the elemental by concentrating upon it, and if his or her concentration is broken by being damaged or grabbed, he or she will lose control of the elemental. The magic user’s ability to control the elemental is limited to 30 ft. There is a 1 in 20 chance per round after the second round that the elemental will break free of the magic user’s control even if the magic user is concentrating upon maintaining it.

If the elemental breaks free of the magic user’s control or if the magic user ceases to concentrate upon it, it will seek to attack the magic user as soon as it can finish any combat in which it is involved. A magic user can, of course, avail him- or herself of protections against an elemental such as the use of a magic circle or a [protection from evil](/srd/spells/cleric/protection-from-evil) spell.

The material component for this spell is a large quantity of the appropriate elemental substance.

This spell transforms an existing fire into a powerful mental snare. Any creature within the spell’s radius who even so much as glances at the fire must make a saving throw vs spells or be entranced by the dancing flames. While so entranced, the creature becomes susceptible to the caster’s words, in the same manner as with a suggestion spell, but with a penalty of –3 to the saving throw. The enchantment will be broken if the entranced creature can no longer see the flames or if it is attacked.

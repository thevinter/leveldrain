The caster evokes a magical sword into being and can wield it by exerting his or her will. While doing so, he or she cannot cast spells, use magic items, or move, although the spell does not end if the magic user’s concentration is broken; the sword simply does not attack during that round. The sword attacks as a fighter one-half the magic user’s caster level (and always hits on a natural 19 or 20), and it can hit creatures that can ordinarily be hit only with magic weapons. The damage caused by the sword is considerable; it inflicts 5d4 hp against size S and M creatures, or 5d6 against larger creatures. The sword can be dispelled by [dispel magic](/srd/spells/cleric/dispel-magic). The material components for the spell cost 500 gp or more.

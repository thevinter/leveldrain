This spell affects a circular area with a 15 ft radius. A number of creatures within this radius (determined by their HD) fall into a deep magical slumber with no saving throw allowed. Magically sleeping creatures may be killed or tied up at a rate of one per round by a single person, or can be attacked at twice the normal rate with an automatic hit for maximum damage, if the attacker chooses not to kill or bind them. A sleeping creature requires a full round to waken and must be shaken or slapped to bring it to consciousness; mere noise, however loud, will not disturb the enchanted slumber of a sleep spellâ€™s victim. The number of enemies affected by the spell is a function of their hit dice. If there are creatures of different hit dice in the area, the weaker ones will be affected first. Creatures with hit dice over 4+4 are not affected by the spell.

| 1+ to 2            | 2d4             |
| 2+ to 3            | 1d4             |
| 3+ to 4            | 1d2             |
| 4+1 to 4+4         | 0 or 1 (d2-1)   |

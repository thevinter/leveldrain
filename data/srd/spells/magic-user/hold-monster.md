A *hold monster* spell completely immobilises up to four creatures of any kind for the spell’s duration. The magic user decides how many creatures he or she will target with the spell: if there is only one target, the saving throw is made at –3; if two, each makes the saving throw at –1; and if the magic user seeks to hold three or four enemies, each makes its saving throw with no penalty. If a magic item or spell operates partially to negate the effects of paralysis, failure on the saving throw will have the effect of a slow spell rather than completely immobilising the target. Creatures held by this spell may be killed or bound at a rate of one per round, or, if the attacker chooses, may be attacked at twice the normal rate with an automatic hit, for maximum damage.

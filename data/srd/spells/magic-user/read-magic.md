Read magic is normally the first spell in every magic user’s spell book, and its mastery is the fi rst task of every apprentice. The spell allows the caster to read magical writings (other than his or her own, of course, which are always intelligible to the original author).

Unless the writings are cursed, reading magical script does not normally activate the magic formulae described therein— reviewing a scroll prior to casting from it does not, for instance, actually cast whatever spell is written upon the scroll. Once the magic user has read a particular set of magical inscriptions by use of this spell, the spell is no longer needed to re-read the writing at a later time.

The reverse of the spell allows the magic user to make magical writings indecipherable for the spell’s duration, and is cast upon the writing rather than upon the caster him - or herself.

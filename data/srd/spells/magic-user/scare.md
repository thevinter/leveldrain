This spell causes terror in creatures of less than 6th level or 6 HD. Such creatures are entitled to a saving throw, which, if successful, allows them to shake off the spell’s effect entirely. If a creature fails the saving throw, however, it will become frozen with terror. If forced, it can fight, but it suffers a penalty of –1 to all attacks, damage, and saving throw rolls.

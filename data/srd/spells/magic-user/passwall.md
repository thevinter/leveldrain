By means of a passwall spell, the magic user creates an interdimensional opening through any non-metallic material, allowing him or her and any others to simply walk directly into the hillside or through a wall. More than one spell may be used in succession to create longer passages. The inside of the passageway is still a part of the material plane; the interdimensional warping of space simply acts to “remove” the material through which the passage is created

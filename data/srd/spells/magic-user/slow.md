This spell acts upon its targets to slow down their movements, or can be used to negate the effects of a haste spell. Any creature affected by a slow spell will find that it can only move at half normal speed and attack at half its normal rate. The spell may be cast upon up to 1 creature/ caster level, but all must be within the area of the spellâ€™s area of effect at the time of casting. If more than one slow spell is cast upon the same subject, the effects of the two spells will be cumulative.

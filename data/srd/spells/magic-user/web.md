This spell causes a mass of tough, sticky webs to appear, filling in any open spaces where the webs can be anchored on both sides (floor and ceiling, between walls, etc.), up to the maximum of the spell’s area of effect. Any creature in the area must make a saving throw at a penalty of –2. The effect of a successful saving throw depends upon how close the target is to the edge of the area of effect; if the creature is within five ft of the edge of the spell’s area of effect, the creature has jumped free and is not affected by the web. If the creature is not within five ft of the edge and makes its save, that creature will be able to fight its way through the web at twice normal speed (at a rate of 1 ft per turn if its strength is less than 13) and will have no chance of suffocating. No creature within the area of effect, whether a saving throw is made or not, can cast spells or attack. Any creature that fails its saving throw has a cumulative 5% chance of suffocating per turn. Creatures with a strength of less than 13 that fail the saving throw are trapped within the web and cannot move or act at all. Creatures with a strength of 13-17 are capable of moving through 1 ft of webs per turn. A creature with strength 18+ can move through the web at a rate of 10 ft per turn, and creatures such as dragons virtually ignore the webs, breaking through at a rate of 100 ft per turn. The strands of a web spell are very fl ammable. If they are ignited, fire will fl ash through the entire web, dealing 2d4 points of damage to all creatures within and burning away the webs.

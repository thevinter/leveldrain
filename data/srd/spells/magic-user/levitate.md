This spell allows the magic user to levitate him- or herself or another person, to a maximum weight of 100 lbs/ level. The magic user can move vertically up or down at a rate of 20 ft per round, and can levitate another at a rate of 10 ft per round. The spell may be cast upon an unwilling enemy, but in this case the intended target is entitled to a saving throw. The spell does not allow any sort of horizontal movement (aerial agility level Iâ€”see Chapter III), but it is possible for a levitated person to pull him- or herself along if there is something upon which to gain purchase, such as a wall.

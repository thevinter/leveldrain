This spell may be used to erase normal or magical writing from an area about two pages wide. The base chance to erase a magical writing is 50% + 2%/ caster level, and the base chance to erase non-magical writing is 50% + 4%/ caster level. 

Obviously, the main benefit of this spell is that the erasure can be made at a distance. The spell does not remove such magical rune-traps as [symbol](/srd/spells/magic-user/symbol), [glyph of warding](/srd/spells/magic-user/glyph-of-warding) or [explosive runes](/srd/spells/magic-user/explosive-runes) (exception: the caster may use it to remove such spells if he or she originally cast them him- or herself).

By casting this spell, the magic user gains the ability to move earth, sand, and clay in vast quantities by the mere gestures of his or her hands. The spell does not affect rock or stone. Unlike most spells, the area of effect does not depend upon the caster’s level but upon the amount of time spent in casting. For every turn spent casting, the magic user can move a cube of earth 40x40x40 ft.

The spell is normally used to create walls, moats, etc., but can also be used to move an intact terrain feature from one place to another (although the spell cannot move rock unless the rock is carried within the moved earth).

If an intact feature (such as a portion of a forest or the foundations under a cottage) is to be moved, an earth elemental must also be summoned. Without the assistance of an elemental, the earth under a cottage could certainly be moved, but with the—presumably undesired—result of destroying the cottage in the process.

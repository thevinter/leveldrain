This spell creates a powerful, magical hand similar to that of the magic user spell [interposing hand](/srd/spells/magic-user/interposing-hand). Unlike the [interposing hand](/srd/spells/magic-user/interposing-hand), the [forceful hand] can push opponents or objects. The hand can move a creature weighing 500 lbs or less. It reduces the speed of a creature between 500 and 2,000 lbs to no greater than 10 ft / round, and it slows the movement of creatures heavier than 2,000 lbs but smaller than 8,000 lbs to one-half. As in the case of the [interposing hand](/srd/spells/magic-user/interposing-hand), the [forceful hand] has as many hit points as the caster.

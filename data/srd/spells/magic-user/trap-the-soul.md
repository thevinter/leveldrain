This spell traps a victim’s soul within a gem for eternity unless the prisoner is rescued. The prison must be prepared ahead of time, by the use of various spells and rituals costing 1,000 gp per level or hit die of the creature to be trapped. The trap may be sprung by either of two methods: either speaking the final word of the spell (which requires one segment and grants the target a saving throw) or persuading the victim to accept a pre-prepared trigger item (in which case no saving throw is permitted—the imprisonment is automatic). When a being is freed from imprisonment, even player characters, the being that has performed the rescue may demand a service or task from the freed prisoner. For unknown reasons, the request affects the prisoner in the same manner as a geas.

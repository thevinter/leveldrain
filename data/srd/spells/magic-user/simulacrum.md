This eerie spell permits the magic user to make a living duplicate of another creature using ice or snow as the raw material of the duplicate’s substance. The simulacrum is identical in appearance to the original in even the minutest detail, although there are many differences in other respects. The simulacrum will always be weaker than the original, having only half of the original hit points and a lower level of experience (1d4+1 x10%). The simulacrum does not have its own personality; it is under the caster’s control and has no volition without the caster’s spoken command. A simulacrum can be improved by the use of other spells; a reincarnation spell will provide it with its own personality, and a limited wish may be used to give it the original’s personality and 40-60% of the original’s memories. Casting the spell requires material components of 1,000 gp in value, and a part (even so small as a piece of hair) of the creature to be duplicated.

When the magic user casts this spell, the recipientâ€™s bare hands and feet become sticky enough to allow him or her to climb walls and even crawl along a ceiling. The movement rate for such climbing is 30 ft per round. The subject of this spell will find it diffi cult to employ tools or handle small objects with precision while the spell is in effect.

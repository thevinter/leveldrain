This spell causes dirt to begin piling out from the ground, digging a hole with tremendous speed. The excavation proceeds at a rate of one 5 x 5 ft cube per round, as earth boils out of the area the caster directs, landing to the edges of the pit. If the spell is cast directly beneath a creature, the creature will fall in without any possibility of a saving throw. Creatures at the edge of the pit have some likelihood of falling in; they must roll lower than their dexterity score on a d20 to avoid sliding into the sudden maelstrom of moving earth. A creature moving toward the pit during the first round in which digging begins must make a saving throw vs spells (unlisted categories) or fall into the hole. The spell can be used to excavate in dirt, sand, or mud. Note that if the pit is taken deeper than 5 ft, there is a chance that it will collapse in on itself (roughly 25%, adjusted by the GM for the type of material being dug).

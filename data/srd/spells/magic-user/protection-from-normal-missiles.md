The subject of this spell becomes completely invulnerable to the effects of projectiles. The spellâ€™s power is not sufficient completely to ward off the larger missiles hurled by siege engines such as catapults and ballistae, nor the enchantment of a magic arrow or bolt, but does reduce any damage caused by such weapons by 1 hit point per die of damage. The spell conveys no protection whatsoever against spells, including spells with missile-like qualities such as fi reball or ray of enfeeblement

Meteor-like chunks of magical fire streak from the magic user’s outstretched hand, exploding into an inferno of flame when they strike the intended targets. The caster may hurl four large meteors or eight small meteors. These missiles strike the first creature in their straight-line trajectories automatically, granting no saving throw and inflicting full damage. When the meteor strikes its target, the explosion of fire may catch other creatures in its radius. These creatures receive saving throws for half damage. Large meteors inflict 10d4 hp damage and explode in a radius of 15 ft. Small meteors inflict 5d4 hp damage and explode in a radius of 7½ ft. If the explosions overlap, a creature in this area is subject to damage from all the explosions, but is entitled to a separate saving throw (halving damage) for each.

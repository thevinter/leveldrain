This spell is the culminating moment involved in the creation of a true magic item, when the item is actually infused with the magic properties it has been painstakingly prepared to hold. Before the spell can actually be cast, the magic user must engage in considerable time-consuming and meticulous work, or the spell will certainly fail. 

Firstly, the item itself must be of absolutely the finest quality available, in terms of craftsmanship, although it need not necessarily be fancy. In most cases, special components such as powders or threads will be incorporated into the itemâ€™s construction, costing not less than 100 gp. The casting of the spell takes 1d8+2 days, with the caster working steadily upon the item for eight hours per day. No other spells may be cast during this period of time, nor can the magic user engage in any other meaningful work. When the final words of the spell are spoken, the item makes a saving throw against spells at the same level as the magic user, but with success on the saving throw indicating that the spell has succeeded. A natural result of 1 on this roll always indicates failure of the spell. At this point, the magic user may begin to infuse the item with enchantments, each of which requires 5d8 hours to complete. Most magic items will require unusual components; dragon scales or blood for a sword with an unusually high bonus against dragons, for example. The GM will determine exactly what is required for any particular magic item.

This spell is not permanent unless a [permanency](/srd/spells/magic-user/permanency) spell is cast upon it; the duration of the enchantment may be for a year or more without a [permanency](/srd/spells/magic-user/permanency) spell, but the enchantment will eventually fail if it is not locked in to the item

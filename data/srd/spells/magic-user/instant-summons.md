This spell calls a specific, desired object into the caster’s hand from wherever it might be. The object must be prepared ahead of time, with the first part of the spell being cast upon it at that time—all but the final word of the incantation. The item is then touched with another item, the spell’s focus, which must be of at least 5,000 gp in value (usually a gem). When the caster seeks to summon the item by means of this spell, he must hold the focus item in his hand and speak the final word of the spell. The focus item will disappear and the summoned item will appear in its place. The summoned item cannot be heavier than 8 lbs or the spell will not function. Moreover, if the item is in the possession (not necessarily in the hand) of another creature, the spell will fail. However, in this instance, the caster will learn the item’s location, and some details about the owner, as determined by the GM. The spell will function across the planes.

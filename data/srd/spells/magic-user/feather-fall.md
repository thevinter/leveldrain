This spell causes creatures or objects in the area of effect to fall as slowly and lightly as feathers, at a rate of about 10 ft in six seconds (1 segment). No damage is taken from the distance spent falling under the influence of the spell, but it is worthy of note that if the spellâ€™s target has not landed by the time the spell expires, the fall will resume at normal speed and damage will be taken for the remaining distance. The magic user can affect a weight of up to 200 lbs plus another 200 lbs/ caster level. The spell may be used to slow propelled objects such as arrows, but will not affect sword blows or other non-propelled forces.

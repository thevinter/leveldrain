This spell allows the magic user to confer the ability to see in the dark, perceiving variations of heat in the infrared spectrum. The range of this vision is 60 ft. Lamps and other light sources tend to spoil the effects of infravision. Infravision does not perceive invisibility any more than normal vision.

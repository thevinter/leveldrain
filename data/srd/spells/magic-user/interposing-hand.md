This spell creates a magical hand with the same number of hit points as the caster. The magic user can cause the hand to be as small as his or her own, or as large as a shield. The caster selects a foe, and the hand will place itself between the magic user and that particular enemy, moving so rapidly that it cannot be avoided. It is strong enough to hold back any creature weighing 200 lbs or less and will slow heavier opponents to half movement. The movement rates of opponents of truly massive size (such as dragons) will be adjudicated by the GM, being slowed to a quarter movement rate or pushing the hand aside entirely

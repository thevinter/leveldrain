When the spell is completed, a wall of stone is called into being, sprouting from existing stone formations. In order for the spell to succeed, there must be existing rock large enough to serve as the anchor on each side of the wall. No rock from the foundation is consumed; the wall’s stone is created from nothing, but needs existing rock from which to emerge and with which to meld. The wall itself is one quarter of an inch thick for each level of the magic user and has an area of 20 x 20 ft per caster level. The wall need not be vertical, but must be anchored—a bridge is a good example of a way to create and use a horizontal wall of stone. The wall may be dispelled, but otherwise has all the characteristics of natural stone

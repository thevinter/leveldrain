The caster momentarily reverses gravity in the area of effect, which is thirty by thirty ft square, extending a mile into the air. Any object or creature in this area will “fall” upwards for a distance of 20 ft, striking intervening objects as per a normal, downward fall. When the duration ends, of course, they will fall downward again.

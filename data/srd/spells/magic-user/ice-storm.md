The caster may evoke one of two different forms of ice storm with this spell: a hailstorm or a sleet storm. The hailstorm is a vicious barrage of huge hailstones that pound into a 40 ft x 40 ft area, throwing up bits of shrapnel-like ice fragments as the hail shatters. Any creature within the area suffers 3d10 hit points of damage with no saving throw. The sleet storm is a maelstrom of frozen rain in an 80 ft x 80 ft area, blinding all creatures in the area of effect and making the footing so slippery that all movement is cut by 50%. There is also a 50% probability that any creature attempting to move while in the sleet storm will slip and fall prone.

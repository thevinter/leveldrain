Upon the completion of this spell, the caster’s form and mind alter as he or she takes on the spirit and attributes of a powerful berserker warrior. The caster’s existing hit points are doubled, and any damage sustained is fi rst deducted from the “additional” hit points with no deduction from the “true” hit points until the additional hit points are gone. Once the additional hit points are gone, however, the caster sustains twice normal damage from attacks. The caster’s armour class improves by four points, and he or she attacks as a fi ghter of the same level. The transformed magic user may only use a dagger as a weapon while in this berserk state, but may attack twice per round, infl icting a +2 bonus on all damage. The magic user cannot cancel the effects of this spell, and will continue to attack until all enemies are killed or the spell duration ends. In order to cast this spell, the magic user must consume a potion of heroism.

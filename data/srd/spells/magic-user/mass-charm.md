This spell functions as does [charm monster](/srd/spells/magic-user/charm-monster), but affects more than one creature. Total hit dice limits the number of creatures affected; the caster cannot affect a total number of hit dice more than twice his or her caster level. All of the target creatures must be within a 30 x 30 ft area.

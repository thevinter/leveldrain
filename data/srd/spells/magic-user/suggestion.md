This spell empowers the caster to suggest facts or courses of action with an almost unavoidable power of persuasion. Factual suggestions (“These are not the halfl ings you seek”), suggestions of a course of action (“You won’t mention you saw us, I have no doubt”), or a combination of both are possible. Even a victim who has failed a saving throw against the spell will not undertake a course of action that is palpably unreasonable, but the experienced caster can easily phrase his or her requests in such a way as to avoid this problem. No creature will leap off a cliff for no reason; but the caster might need to scout the bottom of a chasm and promise to cast a feather fall spell, or hand the victim a “magical” torch that supposedly permits the power of flight. The creature to be influenced must be able to hear and understand the language spoken by the caster.

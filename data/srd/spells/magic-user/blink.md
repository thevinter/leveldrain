This spell is a weak and rather unreliable form of one of the true mage’s most powerful capabilities: teleportation magic. For the duration of the spell, the magic user teleports 2 ft in a random direction once per round. The segment in which the magic user disappears and reappears is determined on 2d4, while the compass direction is rolled on a d8. If the direction roll would result in the caster being teleported into a solid object, the caster will blink a second time, for a distance of no more than 10 ft. If this second blink also results in the caster occupying a solid object, the spell will end, marooning the caster in the æthereal plane of existence. During and after the segment in which the teleportation occurs, the magic user’s sudden change of location prevents any direct attacks upon him or her. The caster may only be attacked directly if the attack is made before the blink takes place. If the caster teleports both from and into an area which is affected by an area of effect spell, he will suffer its effects. The constant changes of location take a toll upon the caster, who has a 25% chance of failing at attempts to cast spells, use most magic items, or take any action beyond making physical attacks.

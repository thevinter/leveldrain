This spell imbues the casterâ€™s hand with a powerful electrical charge that the magic user may use to deliver a deadly shock. The electrical charge can be delivered either by a direct touch (requiring a successful attack roll) or through a conductive material such as metal. This spell is not powerful enough to deliver a dangerous shock through any signifi cant volume of water, but a small quantity of water (a shallow puddle, for instance) could be used as a suitable conductor. The shocking grasp infl icts 1d8 hp of damage, +1 hp per level of the caster

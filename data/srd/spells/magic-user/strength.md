This spell increases a person’s strength (affecting the same sorts of creatures as hold person). The recipient’s strength increases by 1d6, and members of the various fighter-type classes gain a +1 to this roll. If the spell is cast upon a monster (such as an orc), the GM is free to rule for convenience that the effect of the spell is to grant +1 to damage, and if the d6 roll is a 5 or 6, a +1 to hit as well.

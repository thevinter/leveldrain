The caster makes his or her voice (or any sound he or she can vocalize) seem to issue from someplace else, such as from another creature, a statue, from behind a door, down a passage, etc. For each point of intelligence of the listener over 12, there is a cumulative 10% chance to correctly perceive the source of the sound.

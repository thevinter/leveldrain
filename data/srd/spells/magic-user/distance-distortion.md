This spell is cast with a summoned earth elemental as its focus. The casting of the spell is fascinating to summoned elementals and is sufficient to maintain the caster’s control over the elemental (although he or she cannot command it to act while in the process of casting). When the casting is completed, the earth elemental disperses into the substance of the earth as directed, where it creates a dimensional distortion of the spell’s area of effect. Travel through the distorted area takes twice as long (and seems twice as far) as it should, or seems half as long and takes half the normal travel time (determined by the caster when casting the spell). The area does radiate magic, slightly, and the reality will be perceived by [true seeing](/srd/spells/magic-user/true-seeing)(although the travel time will still be altered even for those who know that the distance is distorted). Otherwise, the spell is utterly undetectable. Otherwise, the spell is utterly undetectable.

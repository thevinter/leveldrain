This spell is used to utterly banish a particular demon, devil, or the like to its home plane of existence for a number of years equal to the caster’s level. To cast the spell, the magic user must know the fiendish creature’s name, and inscribe it into a scroll, the preparation of which requires 8d6 hours and the expenditure of at least 5,000 gp. Once the spell is cast, if the scroll is read aloud by the caster in the fiend’s presence it will have the effects described below. A caster can create no more than one scroll for any particular fiend and can only keep three such scrolls in existence at any one time; the magic of one will fade if a fourth is created.

When the caster speaks the first words of the scroll in the fiend’s presence, the demon is immediately held in place (unless its innate magic resistance allows it to escape this effect). Even if the fiend’s magic resistance protects it, the words of the scroll cause considerable agony, and if the creature has the ability to escape it is only 10% likely to remain and try to stop the final reading (0% likelihood if it has no means of attacking the magic user, gaining possession of the scroll, or otherwise infl uencing events in its favour). After one full minute of reading the scroll (i.e., in the second round), the fiend loses 1 hp/ hit die from pain. In the third round, the fiend loses 50% of its remaining hit points from the agony caused by the words of the scroll. After the third round of reading, the fiend is banished to its home plane, where it writhes in agony for a period of years equal to the caster’s level.

Obviously, any fiend caught with this ritual will seek to negotiate its way out; the GM will determine probabilities based on the fiend’s goals and personality, but the base likelihood will be roughly 25% per round that the fiend will agree to perform a task for the caster in exchange for nothing more than the cessation of the ritual.

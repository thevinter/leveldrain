This spell operates as does the [invisibility](/srd/spells/magic-user/invisibility) spell, but affects all creatures within 10 ft of the recipient at the time the final words of the spell are uttered. If the creature upon which the spell was cast makes an attack, the attack will negate the invisibility of all the others. However, if one of the creatures affected by the spell’s radius (not the direct recipient) attacks, the invisibility only of that one creature is negated thereby. In order to remain invisible, those who were made invisible by virtue of the spell’s radius must remain within 10 ft of the creature upon whom the spell is centred. All creatures affected can see each other.

This spell enables the magic user to make a written copy of a spell he or she cannot yet cast, a somewhat dangerous proposition. In order to succeed in this task, the caster must make a saving throw vs spells, with a modifier determined by the difficulty of the spell being transcribed. If the spell is up to one level higher than the magic user can cast, the saving throw is made at +2. If the spell is two levels higher than the magic user can cast, there is no bonus or penalty to the saving throw. If the spell is more than 2 levels higher than the magic user can cast, each additional level adds a â€“1 penalty. If the magic user fails this saving throw, the spell is not successfully copied, the caster takes 1d4 points of damage for each level of the spell, and he or she is knocked unconscious for 1 turn per hit point sustained thereby. The damage sustained cannot be healed more quickly than 4 hp per day, even with the assistance of magical healing. If the saving throw is successful, the magic user may copy the spell, which takes one hour per level of the spell. The material component is ink costing at least 200 gp.

This spell enchants any item that can be opened or closed with a magical trap. When the item is opened by any person other than the caster, magical fire explodes in an area five ft in radius around the fire trapped object, causing 1d4 plus the casterâ€™s level hit points of damage to all creatures in this area. A successful saving throw indicates half damage. The item upon which this spell is cast suffers no damage from the explosion. Detecting a [fire trap] is extraordinarily difficult; attempts to find traps are reduced by one-half in efficacy if the trap is a [fire trap], and the trap will detonate if an attempt to remove traps fails.

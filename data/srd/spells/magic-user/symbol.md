The symbol spell is used to enchant magical runes written on a surface. Any creature that passes by, over, or under the rune; touches it; or reads it will be affected by its magic. There are numerous symbols that can be created with this spell. Those best known are as follows:

**Symbol of Death:** Creatures with hit points totalling not more than 80 are slain.

**Symbol of Discord:** All creatures in the area begin arguing with one another. Those that do not share the same alignment have a 50% chance of actually fighting one another. The duration of the effect is 5d4 rounds, but if a fight breaks out, the duration is reduced to 2d4 rounds.

**Symbol of Fear:** As per fear spell, but save at –4.

**Symbol of Hopelessness:** Creatures that fail to save vs spells are affected by deep depression for 3d4 turns. Each round during this period they act randomly, not acting at all (25%), or walking away from the symbol (75%), even if this means breaking off from combat. Such creatures will submit to any demand made by an enemy or ally, including a command to surrender.

**Symbol of Insanity:** Creatures with total hit points of not more than 120 are affected by lunacy, acting per the random actions described in the confusion spell. The effect is permanent (or until removed by magical means).

**Symbol of Pain:** Any creature triggering the symbol is subjected to horrible pain, losing 2 points of dexterity and gaining a penalty of –4 on all to-hit rolls for a period of 2d10 turns.

**Symbol of Sleep:** This symbol causes any creature of 8+1 HD or less to fall into an enchanted slumber; it is impossible to awaken the victims for 4d4+1 turns.

**Symbol of Stunning:** Creatures with a total of 160 or fewer hit points are stunned for 3d4 rounds, dropping whatever they are holding.

This spell brings into being a bright, magical illumination almost suffi cient to rival the light of day. In all respects, the spell is identical to the first level cleric spell [light](/srd/spells/cleric/light), but its effects are permanent until dispelled. The light cast is greater than that produced by a [light](/srd/spells/cleric/light) spell, extending 60 ft into the darkness. The magic user spell cannot be used to create continual darkness

Within its limit as to hit dice, this spell slays living creatures in the area of effect. Creatures of 9 or higher hit dice are not affected. The spell kills 4d20 “points” worth of creatures, where (for the purposes of this spell) any creature of fewer than 2 HD counts as one point, creatures of 2 to less than 4 HD count as 4 points, creatures of 4 to less than 7 HD count as 8 points, and creatures from 7 to less than 9 HD count as 10 points. Creatures of the lowest hit dice die first, and fractional “kills” (where insufficient points remain completely to slay the creature) have no effect. Material components for the spell cost 1,000 gp.

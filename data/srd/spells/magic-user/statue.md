The statue spell allows the caster or other recipient of the spell to turn, apparently, into a statue made of stone. The creature can still utilize all of its senses, although the sense of touch is dulled, and only actual damage to the stone is felt. The ensorcelled creature can shift in and out of the statueform in one second and is not limited to one such shift in a single round. During the initial transformation, the creature must make a special system shock roll with a flat 82% chance of success, with a +1 for every point of constitution the creature possesses (100% chance at Con 18). Failing this roll means that the creature dies. The statue does radiate magic slightly and can be detected in this manner as well as with other similar divination spells or items. The initial transformation requires a full round. Damage that actually manages to hurt the stone statue will be incurred by the creature, but the stone is as hard and durable as granite and not easy to chip or break.

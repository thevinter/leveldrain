The power of this spell hurls the victim deep beneath the earth, placing it into a state of suspended animation for eternity, entombed within a cyst of rock. The only way to free an *imprisoned* creature is with the reverse of the spell, and the caster must know the name of the prisoner together with enough detail to clearly identify him or her. A creature freed from *imprisonment* appears at the exact spot where the *imprisonment* took place. When casting the spell’s reverse, if the caster is not specific enough about the imprisoned creature’s identity the spell will normally fail; but there is also a chance it will free the intended creature together with several other *imprisoned* victims from other places in the ground—some far, some (perhaps) near. Some of these freed victims might be from ancient ages and may have been *imprisoned* for a very good reason. The chance of freeing unintended recipients is 1 in 10, and their number can vary considerably (d%).

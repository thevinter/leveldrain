This spell causes a creature or object to grow in size and weight. The spell increases a creature’s size and weight by 20% for each level of the caster (to a maximum increase of 200%) or increases an object’s size and weight by 10% per caster level (to a maximum increase of 100%). The magic user’s power limits the volume of material that he or she can enlarge; the mage can affect no more than 10 cubic ft of living matter, or 5 cubic ft of non-living matter, per level. A normal sized person doubled in size will generally have strength of 18, and tripled in size would have strength of 20+. The spell’s reverse applies in the same ratios, but with the effect of reducing the size of an object or creature. If the spell is cast on an unwilling recipient, a successful saving throw will negate the spell, but willing recipients may choose to forgo the save.

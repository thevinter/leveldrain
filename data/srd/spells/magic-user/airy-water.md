This spell transforms water or other non-magical liquids into a bubble of air in the area surrounding the caster. The bubble has the same density as water and will not support the magic user in the water; he or she will sink or float as normal, surrounded by the bubbleâ€™s atmosphere. The oxygen content of the air in the bubble does not run out until the spell expires.

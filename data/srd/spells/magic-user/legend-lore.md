This spell, when cast, gathers mystical echoes of legend and rumour about a specific person, place, or object. These inchoate rhymes, whispers, and memories form in the caster’s mind until he can finally piece them together into meaningful information. The spell’s power is far greater if the item is actually at hand when the spell is cast, for it can then be used as a focus for the gathering of echoes; casting time under these circumstances will be 1d4 turns. If the item (or place) is not at hand, but some detailed information can be woven into the casting of the spell as a focus for the gathering of legend-echoes, the casting time will be 1d10 days. If all that the caster knows about the object or place is rumour, the casting time will be 2d6 weeks. While casting the spell, the caster may not engage in any other activity other than short breaks to eat and sleep. 

When completed, the spell will reveal the location of any legendary material about the object (or person, or place), and if the spell is cast in the presence of the place, person, or object the spell will invariably gather the legendary lore together into a piece of true information about it. This information, coming as it does from mystical echoes, will take the form of a riddle, rhyme, or other puzzle. In order to cast the spell an item of some value— often a potion—must be used and destroyed in the process. The spell can garner no information about things that have not been the subject of discussion, rumour, rhyme, or legend.

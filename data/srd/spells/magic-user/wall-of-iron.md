By casting wall of iron, the magic user creates a sheet of solid iron, one quarter of an inch thick per caster level, with dimensions of 15 sq. ft/ caster level. The configuration of the square footage is determined by the caster, but must be rectangular. The wall must be vertical if it is created upon the ground, but may be created horizontally in the air, falling to crush whatever is beneath. The wall is natural iron and can be affected by rust or transmutations, but its existence is magical and may be dispelled.

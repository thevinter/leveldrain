This spell may be employed in one of three different forms, depending upon the words and material component used during casting. At the time of memorisation, the magic user need not specify which will be used; these are alternate uses of the same spell, not different versions of it. 

**Ice seed:** conjures a sphere of an intensely cold magical substance that freezes water to a depth of 6 inches over a surface area 100 square ft/ caster level. The ice is thick enough to walk upon without fear of falling through. The duration of the ice is 1 round/ level. The material component for this use is a piece of crystal. 

**Ice ray:** a ray of cold lances from the casterâ€™s hand, inflicting 4 hp/ caster level against anything in its path. A successful saving throw results in no damage. Even if the ray strikes an object, it continues on the other side until it has extended 10 ft/ caster level or is stopped by a thickness of stone of 1 ft or more. The material component for this use is a gem worth 1,000 gp. 

**Shattering globe:** the spell forms a globe one inch in diameter, cold but not uncomfortable to the touch. When this sphere is thrown (by hand or sling), it will explode upon impact for 4d6 hit points of damage within a 10 ft radius (half if save vs spells). If not used within 1 round/ caster level, it will explode at the time its duration ends. The material component for this use is also a gem worth 1,000 gp.

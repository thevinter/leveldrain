Clairaudience allows the caster to eavesdrop magically upon a particular location. There is no effective limit to the spell’s range, but the location must either be familiar to the caster or be obvious, such as the top floor inside a tower the caster can see, or just beyond a dungeon door. The spell cannot penetrate metal; sheets of any type of metal between the caster and the target area will prevent the magic user from being able to scry upon the area. The caster will be able to hear sounds in a 6 ft radius of the spell’s focal point. The spell cannot be used to scry across planes of existence; it is limited to locations in the same plane in which it is cast.

This spell is cast upon an object, so that when a set of particular conditions are met, a mouth will appear in the object and speak a specific message. The length of the message cannot exceed 25 words. The magic user can set any condition for the appearance of the magic mouth, but the caster’s power limits the range at which the mouth can detect the triggering events. The mouth can “perceive” events at a range of 5 ft/ caster level, but cannot detect invisible creatures. It has no perceptions other than visual, although it does not actually see. Obviously, a player cannot try to phrase conditions using game terms such as “hit dice,” “class,” “level,” etc. but must use terms that would be familiar to the character.

By means of this spell, the caster creates an invisible barrier of magical force. Magic missiles cannot penetrate the barrier at all. The magic user gains an armour class of 2 against any hurled weapon, armour class of 3 against propelled weapons such as arrows, and armour class of 4 against all other attacks. All saving throws against frontal attacks (by wands, dragon breath, etc.) are made at +1 during the spellâ€™s duration. The shield is a frontal defence and grants no benefi ts against attacks from behind or from the rear flanks.

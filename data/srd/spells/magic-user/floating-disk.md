This evocation produces an invisible disk about three ft across, shaped like a shallow bowl. The disk floats in the air and moves in accordance with the casterâ€™s commands (although if it is allowed more than 20 ft from the caster it will disappear). The disk cannot move faster than 60 ft per round. A [floating disk] can carry up to 100 lbs per level of the caster.

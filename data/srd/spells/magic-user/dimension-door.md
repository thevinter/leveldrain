[Dimension door] is a weak form of [teleportation](/srd/spells/magic-user/teleportation), more controllable than blink, but severely limited in range. The teleportation is limited to 30 ft per caster level. Unlike [blink](/srd/spells/magic-user/blink), a [dimension door] spell operates with perfect accuracy, either to a place the caster can see or clearly visualize, or in response to directions (example: “120 ft forward and 30 ft to the right”). If the caster’s directions land him or her inside a solid object, he or she is stunned and trapped in the astral plane, held in a sort of suspended animation for eternity unless rescued. The spell is subject to a maximum weight limit of 500 lbs of additional weight, with each lb of living matter counting for twice its actual weight. Recovery from the experience of this form of teleportation is not immediate, although it is quite rapid. The caster cannot act for a period of 6 segments following the transition.

This spell enhances the magic userâ€™s precision of memory, allowing him or her to retain up to three additional spell levels in his or her mind (3 first level, 1 first and one second level, or 1 third level). The spell may be used for memorisation, or may be used to hold onto the memory of a spell just cast. The spell components are expensive, costing at least 100 gp, and might not be available in rural communities.

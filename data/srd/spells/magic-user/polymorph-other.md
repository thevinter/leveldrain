This spell transforms the victim into another type of creature; a person might be changed into a newt, or a newt into a dragon, for example. Such a transformation can, in rare cases, be fatal. If the spell’s target is successfully transformed, it must make a system shock test against its constitution or die (see, “constitution”). Moreover, there is a base 100% likelihood that the transformed creature will lose its memories and former identity in the change, becoming, for all intents and purposes, the creature into which it was transformed (intelligence cannot be increased by virtue of such a transformation, however).

For every intelligence point of the transformed creature, the base chance is reduced by 5%, and there is a further +/-5% alteration for each level (or HD) by which the original form’s level (or HD) differs from that of the new form. This check is made on a daily basis, so such a transformation will, eventually, become inevitable according to the laws of chance if the transformed creature is not magically brought back to its original form. A transformed creature retains its former hit points, but otherwise assumes all the physical characteristics of the new form immediately. The transformation may be dispelled, but the second change of shape will necessitate another system shock check

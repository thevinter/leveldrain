As this spell is cast, a ray of unpleasant and indescribable colour arcs from the caster’s hand to strike the chosen target. No attack roll is required to hit. If the target fails a saving throw, its strength and the effect of all attacks which are dependent upon strength are reduced by 25%. The amount of reduction is increased by 1%/ caster level (to be rounded off in the case of lower-level magic users simply as a matter of convenience). Thus, if an orc is struck with the ray by a level one magic user, the orc would lose 26% (rounded to 25%, at the option of the GM) of its strength. Its to-hit rolls are not affected, but any damage it infl icts is reduced to 75% (or 74%) of the damage rolled (a good GM avoids minuscule calculations that might bog down the game). A ray of enfeeblement may technically reduce the target’s strength below the required minimum to qualify for a class, but its effects are too temporary to affect class choices (so an enfeebled paladin with a temporary strength of 8 retains his or her paladinhood). Any further effects of the reduced strength are determined by the GM.

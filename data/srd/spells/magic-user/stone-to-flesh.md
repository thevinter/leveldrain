This spell transforms stone into flesh, or vice versa if the caster has elected to memorise the reversed version, flesh to stone. A creature that has been turned to stone will be returned to its normal state (provided that a system shock roll is successful). If the spell is used upon normal stone (as opposed to restoring a petrifi ed creature), up to 9 cubic ft/ caster level may be transformed. A saving throw is permitted only against the spellâ€™s reverse, flesh to stone

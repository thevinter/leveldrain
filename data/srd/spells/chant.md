Once the spell is cast, the cleric must maintain a sonorous chanting of holy words and prayers, which not only lend divine favour to the cleric and his or her allies but also bring disfavour to their foes. For so long as the cleric remains stationary and continues to chant, his or her allies (within the area of effect) gain a bonus of +1 to all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. Enemies within the spell’s area of effect also suffer a –1 to all such die rolls. If the cleric sustains damage, is grappled, or is in some way silenced, the effect of the spell will end.

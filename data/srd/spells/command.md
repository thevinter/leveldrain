By speaking a single word of command with the force of divine power behind it, the cleric may force a creature to obey an order. The creature must be able to hear the cleric and understand the language in which he or she utters the command. The command may be only one word, must be a verb, and must be completely unambiguous. “Halt,” “Flee,” and “Sleep” are typical commands, but many others are possible. The effects may not extend beyond a single round, and the command “Die” has the same effect as the command to “Sleep”. Creatures with intelligence of 13+ and/or hit dice of 6+ gain a saving throw against the spell’s influence.

This spell enables the cleric to transform sticks into serpents that attack at the clericâ€™s will. The snakes may be ordered to take other actions if the cleric can speak with them, but this spell alone does not grant the power to communicate with the snakes, only to will them to attack particular opponents. The spell transforms one stick per caster level, and each snake has a 5% chance per caster level of being venomous. The reverse of the spell will change snakes into harmless sticks and can work such a transformation upon snakes created by means of this spell. Sticks of a magical quality, such as wands or magic spears, are not affected by the spell.

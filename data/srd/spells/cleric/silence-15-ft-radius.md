Casting this spell brings into being an area of complete and utter magical silence in which no sound can be heard. The spell may be cast upon a location in the air, upon a physical object (in which case it will move with the object), or upon a creature (in which case a saving throw is applicable). If the creature makes a saving throw, the area of silence will centre upon the space just behind the intended victim.

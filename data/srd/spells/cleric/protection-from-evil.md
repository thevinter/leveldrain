This spell surrounds the recipient with an invisible aura of divine protection, emanating from the recipient to a distance of one foot. The aura is not invulnerable, but it affords considerable protection against evil and summoned creatures, much as a powerful magic circle would. The power of the aura is such that, regardless of alignment, neither summoned nor conjured creatures, nor those not native to the material planes (such as demons or genies), can reach through it. It is possible, of course, for a weapon wielded by such a creature to breach the magical barrier, but the creature’s physical presence is completely hedged out. Moreover, the attacks of evil creatures (with or without a weapon) incur a penalty of –2 to hit, and saving throws caused by such creatures will be made at a bonus of +2. The spell may be reversed into protection from good, and in this form it will still hedge out summoned, conjured, and extra-planar creatures regardless of alignment. To cast either form of the spell, the caster speaks the ritual words of the spell while describing a circle around the being to be warded, using holy water or incense (blood or smouldering dung for the reverse of the spell).

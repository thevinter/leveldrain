This spell detoxifies any sort of venom in a creature or object touched by the cleric. An opponent (a venomous spider, for example) must be successfully touched by the cleric, but is not entitled to a saving throw if the attack succeeds. Note that if the venomous creature produces new venom (normally a process that takes time), the new venom will be toxic, but any venom that is stored up in the creature will be affected and detoxified. The spell may also be used to prevent a poisoned character from suffering the poisonâ€™s effects. The reverse of the spell allows the cleric to deliver a lethally poisonous touch, requiring a successful roll to hit, and allowing a saving throw against the poison

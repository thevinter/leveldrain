The powerful regeneration spell causes severed body parts to reattach themselves in a single round, or to regrow within 2-8 turns. The spellâ€™s reverse causes a touched appendage to wither and fall away to dust within 2-8 turns. A successful attack must be made in order to cast the spell upon an unwilling victim, but the victim does not also receive a saving throw.

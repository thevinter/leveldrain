By means of this spell, the cleric may cure most diseases by laying hands upon the afflicted creature. Depending upon the nature of the disease, full recovery may require as little time as a single turn, or as long as a week. The spell’s reverse, cause disease, requires that the cleric successfully touch the intended victim, who is permitted a saving throw against the spell’s insidious effects. If the saving throw is failed, the effects of the disease will manifest within 1d6 turns, inflicting 1 hit point of damage per turn thereafter and one point of lost strength per hour (6 turns) until the victim is reduced to 10% of his or her original hit points and strength. Until the disease is cured or runs its course, the afflicted person will not be able to naturally recover either strength or hit points over and above 10%. The disease runs its course in 1d6 days.

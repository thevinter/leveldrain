This spell is a divine warding against fear, and it can also banish magical terror in someone already affected. In the latter case, the spell grants a second saving throw at a bonus of +1 per caster level. To a person not already affected by magical fear, the spell grants a bonus of +4 to fear saving throws for 1 turn.

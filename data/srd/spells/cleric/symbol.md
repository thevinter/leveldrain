To cast this spell, the cleric shapes a glowing symbol in the air. Any creature seeing the symbol closely enough to discern its shape (approximately 100 ft) will be affected by it. The clerical casting of this spell allows for three different symbols: Hopelessness, Pain, and Persuasion.

**Hopelessness:** The symbol of hopelessness causes despair. Any creature (other than those with no intelligence) failing the saving throw will wander sadly away or surrender in the face of a challenge such as a combat. The despair will persist for 3d4 turns.

**Pain:** The symbol of pain infl icts terrible, shooting pains for a duration of 2-20 turns. Any creature so affected will suffer a –4 penalty on attack rolls and a temporary loss of 2 dexterity points.

**Persuasion:** Those viewing the symbol of persuasion and failing their saving throw will undergo a temporary change of alignment to the caster’s alignment and become friendly to the caster for 1d20 turns.

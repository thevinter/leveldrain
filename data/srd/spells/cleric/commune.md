The commune spell establishes a mystical link between the cleric and his or her deity, permitting the cleric to ask one yes or no question per caster level. This extraordinarily powerful divination spell does not involve any chance of the cleric’s misinterpretation of omens, for the spiritual communion with the deity is direct and not conveyed through symbols or portents. It is likely that a cleric who resorts to this spell too frequently, or for matters not worthy of the god’s attention, may fall from divine favour enough that he or she loses the ability to cast the spell, at least for a time

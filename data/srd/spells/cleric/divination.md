A divination spell gives the caster divine insight about a particular place, examples being a ruined castle, a particular region in a dungeon, or a small vale. The location of the place must be known to the cleric (e.g., the “Red Mausoleum,” if a legendary location, cannot be the focus of the spell, but if the cleric has seen the doorway of the tomb, the spell will be effective). The spell yields rich information compared to an augury, although it may be couched in rather vague and approximate terms.

The spell reveals the relative power of the creatures in the area, the treasure (“low,” “moderate,” or “rich”), and chances of incurring the wrath of gods or similar beings if the place is disturbed. There is a chance that the cleric will fail to interpret the omens properly; the base chance to succeed in gaining truthful information is 60%, and rises by another 1% per caster level. The chance may also be adjusted by the GM as necessary.

If the cleric’s reading of the omens is not correct, of course, he or she will be operating on completely false and useless “insights.” The casting of a divination spell is quite dramatic, involving the sacrifice of a dove or other such creature appropriate to the religion in question. Valuable items may also be sacrificed, and such may increase the chance of the cleric receiving clear omens that are easily interpreted.

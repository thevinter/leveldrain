Casting prayer is a matter of intoning an invocation to the cleric’s god(s), following which any of the cleric’s allies who were in the spell’s area of effect will gain, for the duration of the spell, the same benefits as if they were affected by an ongoing chant spell. Note that the cleric is able to move and take other actions while the prayer spell is in effect, which is not the case with the more restricted chant spell.

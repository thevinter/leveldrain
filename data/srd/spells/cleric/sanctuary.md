A sanctuary spell makes the cleric seem an irrelevant, nonhostile target, one that his or her enemies will ignore. In order for any foe to attack the caster of the spell, the enemy must make a successful saving throw against magic. Failing the saving throw permits the enemy to attack another target, but the cleric will be completely ignored. The spell does not prevent an enemy from including the cleric within the area of effect of a hostile spell, provided that the cleric is not the intended target. The cleric may not undertake any hostile actions while protected by a sanctuary, or the spellâ€™s power will be dissipated and end. However, the cleric may cast spells and otherwise act in ways that are not directly hostile, such as curing wounds, casting a spell such as bless, or even stealing an item if faith and alignment permit

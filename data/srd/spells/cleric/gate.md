A gate spell creates an opening between the material plane and another plane of existence, summoning forth a being from the other plane. The caster must know the name of the creature he or she is attempting to summon, or the spell will fail. The particular creature named in the spell’s casting might choose not to step through the gate into the material plane. Summoning Thor is unlikely to bring the thunder god from the halls of Valhalla—however, a being of some kind will certainly respond to the summons. Thor, if summoned, might choose to send a Valkyrie, for instance. Casting this spell can be risky, for the caster has no control over the summoned creature unless proper precautions are taken, such as a protection from evil spell, the drawing of appropriate magical circles, etc. Beings summoned from distant planes of existence, particularly beings with individual names of their own, can be powerful and irascible.

By means of a quest spell, the cleric enslaves the subject into fulfilling a task the cleric sets, forcing him or her to perform the task and return to the cleric with proof of its completion. If the enchanted creature does not properly follow the letter and spirit of the quest, it will suffer a cumulative penalty of â€“1 to all saving throw rolls for each day the quest is neglected. This penalty, which is itself in the nature of a curse, remains with the creature until the quest is completed or the curse is removed by the caster or by some other agency. Possible objectives for a quest are legion; they might include finding and bringing some valuable item to the cleric, capturing a castle, slaying a monster, or any number of other tasks.

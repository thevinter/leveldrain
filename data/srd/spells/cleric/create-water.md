This spell creates potable water, four gallons per level of the caster. The water may be created in a receptacle or in thin air (whence it will, of course, fall). Water cannot be created inside a creature, nor can it be created in any place the caster cannot see. The reverse of the spell destroys water (including fog, steam, mist, etc.) in the same quantities as create water

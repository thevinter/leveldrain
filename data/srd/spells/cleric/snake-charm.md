A pattern of gestures made by the cleric in the course of casting this spell creates a hypnotic effect on snakes. Any snake affected by the spell will rise up and begin swaying back and forth, otherwise remaining motionless. A cleric can affect multiple serpents with the spell, up to a total number of hit points equal to the cleric’s own. The spell’s duration depends upon the existing emotions of the snake at the time the spell is cast. If the snake was asleep, the duration of the charm is 1d4+2 turns; if the snake was awake but not angry, the duration will be 1-3 turns; and if the snake was angry (or attacking), the spell will last 1d4+4 rounds.

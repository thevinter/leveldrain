Any object (not creature) known or familiar to the caster may be located within the spell’s range. It is not necessary for the caster to have seen the precise object that the spell will locate: if the caster is familiar with ladders in general, he or she may cast the spell successfully to locate any ladder within the spell’s range. The spell is directional, requiring the cleric to turn in different directions in order to sense an object in his or her path. The cleric may move after casting the spell to search a broader area, and need not be in actual line of sight of the object. (In other words, the spell’s effect is not hindered by walls or other such obstacles.) The reverse of the spell may be used to obscure one object from magical detection of virtually all kinds (including such means as a crystal ball as well as divination spells).

This spell imbues one creature with an uncanny sense for the shortest route into or out of a chosen locale. The spell imparts only a visceral intuition of the right direction and shortest distance, so it is impossible to use the spell either to circumvent dangers or to draw a map. This spell may be used to escape from a maze spell (q.v.) in one round and will continue to function thereafter. The spellâ€™s reverse makes a creature unable to make any signifi cant movement beyond aimless wandering.

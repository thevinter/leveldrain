The awesome power of a resurrection spell brings the dead back to life. Unlike raise dead, a resurrection spell may be cast upon a person who has been dead for as many as 10 years per caster level. Casting the spell requires the cleric to rest for one day per level of the person raised. Elves cannot be resurrected, having no souls, but humans and the rest of their ilk (half-elves, dwarfs, etc.) can be affected. As with raise dead, the recipientâ€™s memory of whatever transpired between death and resurrection is erased. The reverse of the spell kills the subject and turns him or her to dust, requiring a successful attack roll to touch.

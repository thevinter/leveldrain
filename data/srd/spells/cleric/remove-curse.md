This spell allows the cleric to remove curses from persons and objects, and the spell can have a variety of other applications against evil manifestations. Magical items imbued with curses cannot be destroyed by the spell’s power, but use of the spell upon a person under the influence of such an item will generally free the person from the curse and allow him or her to be rid of the item.

The spell’s reverse, bestow curse, inflicts the subject with a magical curse, the exact nature of which is not entirely within the caster’s control:

**Reduce one ability score to 3:** 50%
**Cause –4 penalty to hit and on saving throws:** 25%
**Cause victim (50% chance per turn) to drop any objects it is holding (or in the case of an non-toolusing creature, not act for one round):** 25%

With the GM’s agreement, the character may design a specific curse to use with this spell other than the random curse the spell normally unleashes. In order to bestow a curse, the cleric must successfully touch the intended victim, who is entitled to a saving throw. The duration of a bestowed curse is 1 turn/ caster level.

This spell causes water to draw apart, forming a trench. The depth and length of the water displacement is determined by the clericâ€™s level. For each caster level, the cleric may displace an area of water 30 ft deep and 20 ft wide. The spell can affect other liquids besides water, but the more different the physical properties of the other liquid, the less the cleric may be capable of displacing

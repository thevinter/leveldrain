The glyph of warding is a magically charged sigil or rune, scribed and enchanted to serve as the focal point of a powerful magical trap. The enchantment affects surfaces, with the caster being able to ward up to 5 ft x 5 ft of wall, fl oor, door, etc., per caster level. The cleric writes or otherwise inscribes the surface to be protected with the glyph of his choice, thereby defi ning what effect the glyph will have when discharged. He or she then traces the area to be affected with incense and, if the area to be covered exceeds 50 sq ft, he or she must also sprinkle it with at least 2,000 gp worth of powdered gems to bind the spell over such a large area. When the spell is completed, the glyph and the tracery of its area fade from sight and remain invisible thereafter until the spell is discharged. Any being touching the protected surface without speaking the name of the glyph will discharge the glyph’s power. Depending upon the nature of the glyph, a successful saving throw will either reduce the damage by one-half or negate the glyph’s effects entirely. The amount of power that can be held within a glyph depends upon the caster’s level. Most glyphs cause physical damage from fire or other elemental energies, causing 2 hit points of damage per caster level. More powerful glyphs are known that can induce paralysis or drain experience levels, although these are clearly the province only of the most powerful clerics. The GM must determine what glyphs may be within the capabilities of such formidable individuals.

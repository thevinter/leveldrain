By touching the spellâ€™s intended recipient and casting the spell, the cleric instills the recipient with a supernatural resistance to the effects of extreme cold. Normal cold, temperatures ranging down to zero degrees Fahrenheit, is perceived as normal temperature. The subject also gains a saving throw bonus of +3 against magical cold, taking one half damage if the save is not successful and one quarter damage if the save is successful. The saving throw is permitted even against attacks that would not ordinarily permit a saving throw (such as a magically cold sword).

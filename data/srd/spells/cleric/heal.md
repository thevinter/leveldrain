This spell affects the same general variety of creatures as the cure light wounds spell (q.v.), but it is necromancy on an entirely different level than the various cure spells. Heal removes all hit point damage with the exception of the last 1d4 points, removes blindness, cures disease, and will negates the effects of a feeblemind spell. The reverse, harm, causes damage sufficient to reduce the target to 1d4 remaining hit points, and also causes disease.

When this spell is cast, the recipient gains resistance to fire and heat, being able to endure boiling temperatures without discomfort. A person under the influence of this spell can stand unharmed in the middle of a bonfi re, and even gains a measure of resistance to magical fire. The subject gains a saving throw bonus of +3 against magical fire, taking one half damage if the save is not successful and one quarter damage if the save is successful. The saving throw is permitted even against attacks that would not ordinarily allow a saving throw.

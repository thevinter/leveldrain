Holy word is a spell of intrinsically good alignment. The intonation of a holy word utterly banishes evil creatures not native to the caster’s plane, hurling them back to their respective planes of existence. Additionally, creatures not of good alignment (including those evil creatures which are native to the caster’s plane, as well as neutral creatures not of good alignment) will suffer effects from the holy word in accordance with the creature’s hit dice:

**Less than 4 HD:** Kills
**4-7 HD:** Paralyses (duration 10-40 rounds)
**8-11 HD:** Stuns, reduces move by 50%, causes –4 to attack rolls (duration 2-8 rounds)
**12+ HD:** Deafens, reduces move by 25%, causes –2 to attack rolls, causes 50% chance of spell failure (duration 1- 4 rounds)

The spell’s reverse is unholy word, which functions in the same manner as holy word but against creatures of good alignment rather than evil. Both spells have the same effect upon creatures that are neither of good nor evil alignment

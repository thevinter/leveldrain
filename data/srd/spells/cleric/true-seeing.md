This spell imbues the recipient with the ability to see things as they truly are within a range of 120 ft. Illusions, displacements, astral or æthereal objects and beings, and secret doors are examples of the kinds of deception and unreality that the spell reveals. Alignment auras become visible so that the cleric can discern good from evil, law from chaos. Polymorphed items and creatures are seen in their true shape. The reverse of the spell, false seeing, is in the nature of a curse, making the subject’s perception untrustworthy and contrary in what it reveals.

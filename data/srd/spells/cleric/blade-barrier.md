This enchantment brings into being a whirling wall of steelblades that circle around a fixed point with blinding speed.Any creature stepping through the circle will suffer 8d8 pointsof damage. The cleric sets the focal point and the radius of thebarrier at the time of casting, and these parameters cannot bechanged thereafter (short of dismissing the spell entirely, ofcourse).

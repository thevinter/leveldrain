The light spell creates a globe of light 20 ft in radius, centred upon whatever spot or object the caster indicates at the time of casting (including a location in thin air). The caster may extinguish the magical light at any time. The reverse of the spell, darkness, creates an area of utter darkness just as the light spell creates light, with the only distinction being that the darkness spell has half the duration of a light spell. If either spell is cast upon a living creature, the creature is entitled to a saving throw (success indicating that the spell affects the area just behind the creature). A light spell cast upon a creature’s eyes will blind it for the spell’s duration, causing it a penalty of -4 on all rolls to hit if sight is its primary sense. The light spell remains stationary if it was not originally cast upon a movable object or creature (in which case the target will bring the illumination with it as it moves).

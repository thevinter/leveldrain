By casting this spell, the cleric calls the bones or bodies of dead humans or humanoids to rise and become lesser undead (skeletons or zombies). The undead will obey their creator’s simple commands, following him or her, or perhaps guarding a location he or she designates against any creature (or not guarding it against certain creatures) that might enter. The spell’s effects are permanent, but can be dispelled by the use of dispel magic. Use of this spell is inherently not in accordance with the good alignment and is seldom used by good clerics unless there is pressing need. Moreover, casting the spell in the confi nes of a city may subject the caster to inquiry by secular and religious authorities alike. A cleric may animate one zombie or skeleton per caster level.

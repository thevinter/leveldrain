That's it, we're live. There are so many people with great ideas floating around, and I have some knowledge that allows me to publish said ideas. If you have something made, written, scattered across notes, send it to me at publishing@leveldrain.com

I'll be taking a small percentage on the revenue, no payment upfront, no bullshit. Just write me if you have some ideas and would like to see your homebrew/adventure/setting online.

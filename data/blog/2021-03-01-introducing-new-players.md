Sometimes people ask me how to introduce new players into d&d.

Take a table, sit them around, give them dice to fidget.

"You're on a cliff and there's a cave next to you with red drapes flailing in the wind. You know there's a fuckton of treasure down there. What? I don't know. Magical mirrors and stuff. You hear a scream coming from below. What do you do?"

Great, you're now playing.
